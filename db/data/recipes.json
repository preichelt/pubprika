Again this is like a biscuit dough you don't want to overwork it). Gently place dough ball into oil and fry until golden brown on bottom then flip and cook reverse side until golden brown. Carefully remove with metal tongs or a fork and drain onto a paper towel lined plate. Roll in sugar. Repeat this process with remaining dough (you can fit about 8 donuts in the pan at once if you can work that fast =). Note: these are best enjoyed the day they are made."

      ],
      "directions": [
        "1. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin well with butter and set aside.",
        "2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if mixing by hand), combine the warm milk, yeast and sugar. Let stand 5-10 minutes until foaming. Add butter to the yeast mixture and beat until the butter is slightly incorporated (it will be far from perfect), about 1 minute or so. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed.",
        "3. Add in the flour and salt, then mix at low speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then increase the speed to medium, and mix the dough for 2 minutes longer. The dough will still be soft and a little sticky, and might seem a bit heavy. This is fine. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let it stand for 10 minutes in a warm-ish spot.",
        "4. When ready, on a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to a 11×17-inch rectangle.",
        "5. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Set aside. Brush the 3 tablespoons of melted butter over the dough, then sprinkle with the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate over that, if you’re using it.",
        "6. Beginning at a long edge, roll up the dough as tightly as possible, pinching the seams on both ends. Cut the rolled dough into twelve pieces with a sharp knife, discarding the less pretty end pieces, and set them in the muffin cups cut side up. Cover with a dish towel, and let stand again for 15 minutes.",
        "7. While the dough rises one more time, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Set the muffin tin on a baking sheet (this helps to retain heat and lets the buns bake evenly), and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown and bubbling. While the buns are baking, make the glaze.",
        "8. Combine the brown sugar, butter, heavy whipping cream or milk and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan. Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt, vanilla, and baking soda. The glaze will foam up a little, so allow room for that. I made my glaze a little early and it stiffened up a bit, but you can simply place it back over the heat for a few minutes, stirring the entire time, until it’s warmed up again.",
        "9. When the sticky buns are ready, let them cool in pan for 5 minutes, then use a butter knife to carefully wiggle them out of the muffin tin. Place the sticky buns on a piece of parchment or wax paper, then use a spoon to drizzle the glaze over the hot sticky buns. Sprinkle with pearled sugar, if you like. You can make the buns ahead of time and then place them back in the oven on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees F to warm them back up. I recommend wetting a small piece of paper towel and placing it somewhere on the sheet to add back some moisture if the buns have sat out for a while."

        "Pretzel Dough:Warm up the milk in the microwave or on the stove for just about one and a half minutes. It should be about 110º. If it's too hot it will kill the yeast. You should be able to comfortably keep your finger in it. Stir in the yeast and let it sit for about 3 minutes. Add the butter and sugar. Add the flour about 1 cup at a time and the add the fine salt. Kneed for about 10 minutes with a stand mixer or by hand.Add the chopped apples, cinnamon, and another tablespoon of flour (I found that that just helped the apples mix in better). Mix until well combined. Put it in a greased bowl and cover with greased cling wrap. Let rise for 1 hour in a moist, warm place until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 450º. Punch down dough and divide into 4 lumps. Allow to rest for 10 minutes (I have found this makes it easier to roll them for some reason). Combine the baking soda and warm water in a wide, shallow dish.Roll each lump into a long rope, about 1 inch thick. Dip in the baking soda water. Cut each rope with a sharp, serrated knife into about 15 pieces.Place the pieces on a well greased baking sheet and bake for about 7-11 minutes or until browned.Melt the 8 tablespoons of butter in a wide, shallow dish and in another wide, shallow dish combine the sugars and cinnamon. Dip the hot pretzel bites into the butter and then into the cinnamon sugar mixture. Serve with salted caramel dipping sauce (recipe below).",

Cook over medium heat, stirring until it becomes a dark caramel color (be careful not to burn!). Immediately add the butter and cream (be careful, it will bubble up). Add the salt and vanilla. It will thicken as it cools."

Set stand mixer with whisk attachment and blend mixture to combine. Add in 1 1/2 cups flour and blend until combined, then switch to hook attachment and slowly add in remaining 1 1/2 cups flour. Knead mixture until smooth an elastic, about 5 minutes, adding in additional flour as needed to create a soft dough (it should pull away from sides of the bowl and may slightly stick to the bottom). Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until double in size (I like to place it in the oven with the light on), about 1 1/2 - 2 hours.",

Squeeze 6 Tbsp of the excess liquid from apples into mixing bowl by lifting and pressing grated apples against sides of bowl (or just squeeze in your hands) and reserve juice (you'll be using most of it for the glaze). Sprinkle strained apples evenly over cinnamon sugar layer. Beginning on the long side (the 19-inch side) snuggly roll up to the other end (to the other 19-inch side, this may seem like the wrong side to be rolling, I usually begin with the shorter side, but it works best this way as you want taller not wider rolls for the muffin tins). Cut into 12 - 13 rolls and transfer each rolls to paper lined muffin cups (preferably using 2 - 12 hole muffin tins to allow muffin tops room to expand outward).

        "2 quarts vegetable oil, for frying"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "1. Make the Dough: Place the yeast in a mixing bowl. Pour the milk over the yeast a let sit for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the flour to the yeast and milk mixture, but do not stir. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the surface of the flour cracks, about 30 to 40 minutes.",
        "2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Add the apple cider, melted butter, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, 1¼ cups of the flour and whisk until combined, then add to the yeast mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat the dough on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase the speed to medium and beat for 1 minute. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and mix on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium for another 30 seconds. The dough will be VERY soft and sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1½ hours.",
        "3. Make the Apples: Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the pan with the melted butter and drop the vanilla bean pod in as well. Heat the butter until it is bubbling, then add the chopped apples, tossing to coat them with butter. Add the sugar and cinnamon and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the apple cider and vinegar, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook until all of the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and transfer the apples to a baking sheet to cool.",
        "4. Assemble the Doughnuts: Scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface and pat into a rectangle 2 inches thick, flouring the surface as necessary. Spread half of the apples over the dough, leaving space around the edges. Fold the dough into thirds (like a letter) by folding the bottom up and then the top down.",
        "Use your hands to again pat the dough into another rectangle about 2 inches thick. Spread the remaining apples on top and fold into thirds again.",
        "Gather the dough together in a rough ball and return it to the oiled bowl. Cover and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.",

        "6. Scrape the dough out again onto a well-floured surface and gently pat it out to ½-inch thickness, flouring the surface and the dough as necessary. Using a pizza cutter, bench scraper or sharp knife, slice the dough into 1-inch pieces in a checkerboard pattern. Shape 4 ounce portions of the dough into round mounds and allow to rest for 10 minutes.",
        "7. Make the Glaze: While the dough is resting, mix together the glaze. Whisk together the powdered sugar, heavy cream, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water over low heat. Heat and whisk occasionally until the mixture is warm to the touch. Remove from the heat and keep warm.",
        "8. Fry the Doughnuts: Very carefully drop each mound of dough into the hot oil, only adding as many as will comfortably fit in the pot so they are not crowded (I found I could do 4 or 5 at a time in my 7¼-quart Dutch oven). Fry until the underside is golden brown, about 3 minutes, then using a spatula or spider skimmer, carefully turn them over and continue to cook until the other side is golden brown as well, another 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the doughnuts to a paper towel-lined pan or a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts, allowing the oil to come back up to temperature between batches.",
        "9. After removing each batch of doughnuts, allow them to sit for about 5 minutes, then brush with the glaze. Serve warm or at room temperature."

      "directions": [
        "1. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.",
        "2. To make the apples, place the butter in a medium skilled over medium heat to melt. Add the apples, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Toss with a wooden spoon until all of the apples are coated and the sugar is melted over the apples, about 2 to 4 minutes. The mixture will be warm and glossy, but the apples won't be cooked through, because you're just making a sauce for them. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
        "3. To make the biscuit dough, place flour in a medium bowl and add cold butter cubes. Use your fingers to quickly break the butter down into the flour, until most pieces are about pea-sized (or smaller). Stir in the granulated sugar.",
        "4. Create a well in the center of the butter and flour mixture and add ⅔ cup buttermilk. Stir the mixture together until it is well moistened and holds together well. Biscuit dough should be soft, slightly moist and \"shaggy\". Add the remaining buttermilk as needed. If you're using your own homemade self-rising flour or gluten-free self-rising flour, you'll want to add the full ¾ cup of buttermilk (I ended up using an extra tablespoon or two because I made my own self-rising flour).",
        "5. Use all-purpose flour to generously dust a clear work surface. Spoon the dough onto the floured surface and use your hands to gather it into a ball and gently pat it into a small rectangle. The dough will crack a bit as you shape it into a rectangle, and again as you fold it over the apples. That's OK; just keep patting it back together. Rustic is pretty!",
        "6. Use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough into a rectangle ½-inch thick, about 7-inches x 10-inches (I always keep a ruler in my kitchen for things like this, just to be safe and prevent me from going rolling-crazy). Arrange cooled apples in a single layer over half of the rolled out biscuit dough, then top with the cheese. Fold the bare side of the dough over the apples and gently press the edges to seal in the apples. Use the palms of your hand to pat the dough into a 6 x 8-inch rectangle if the edges are looking a bit rounded.",
        "7. Use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 12 squares. Use a spatula to place each biscuit onto the prepared baking sheet, about 2-inches apart.",
        "8. In a small bowl, whisk together sugar for topping, cinnamon, and salt. Brush each biscuit top with beaten egg and sprinkle generously with the cinnamon sugar mixture. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes until the biscuits are risen and golden brown and the cheese is bubbling. Remove from the oven and serve warm, or cool completely before storing in an airtight container. Biscuits are best enjoyed within two days of baking. Definitely pop them in the microwave to reheat when you go back for seconds!"

Pour milk along with yeast into the bowl of an electric stand mixer and whisk together until yeast has dissolved, let rest 5 minutes. Add brown sugar, 4 tbsp softened butter, 1 cup flour and 2 tsp fine sea salt to milk mixture and using the whisk attachment, stir until blended. Switch attachment to a dough hook, add remaining 3 1/2 cups flour and kneaded mixture on medium low speed until elastic. Mix in up to an additional 1/2 cup flour, as needed, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
        "Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper (alternately you could grease them). Punch dough down several times to release any air pockets. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces (the easiest way to do this is to divide the dough in half, then divide the halves into halves then those and into thirds). Cover divided dough loosely with plastic wrap (just to prevent a dry crust from forming on the outside) and roll each piece out into a long, thin rope about 32 - 36 inches long (I found working on a non-floured to very very lightly floured surface worked best, I began with a lightly floured surface and realized it was much harder to get more stretch, plus it was much faster to roll them out when working on a less-no flour surface). Form dough rope into a pretzel shape.",
        "In a shallow bowl, whisk together baking soda and warm water then fully immerse pretzel into water mixture and allow excess water to drip off (I ended up shaping most of them into the pretzel shape once placing on the cookie sheet rather then doing it twice, I would just fold the rope into halves several times then immerse in water mixture then shape them on cookie sheet). Place on prepared baking sheet, reshape as needed and sprinkle to taste with coarse salt. Repeat this process with remaining dough. Bake pretzels in preheated oven 7 - 11 minutes until golden brown (note that you will likely only be able to cook 6 at a time among the two baking sheets) Remove from oven and brush top and bottom of pretzels with melted butter. Serve warm with optional dipping sauce. Reheat in microwave or in a warm oven once they've cooled, if desired.",
        "*Dipping sauces I would recommend are Yammie's amazing garlic cheese sauce (click here for the recipe), marinara sauce, or honey mustard. For a sweeter option, try with a warm homemade doughnut glaze, caramel sauce or chocolate sauce. Alternately if you want another dessert option, skip the coarse salt step of the recipe and sprinkle instead with lots of cinnamon sugar."

Slice your avocado into fry-like chunks, cover with flour, then egg and finally bread it with the panko and put it on a plate.. Repeat this until all your avocado is done.",

Once the garlic is done, add it into a bowl with your sour cream and a few drops of chili paste (add as much or as little as you want, depending on your heat preference). Mix it all together with a spoon,  mashing up the garlic as much as you can. Taste it once it is thoroughly mixed, if you feel it needs a little more zing, try adding a few drops of lemon juice."

The dough will be in large clumps rather than a homogeneous mass. If all the dry ingredients haven’t been dampened, add the rest of the liquid (plus a little more, if necessary).",
        "3. Scoop the dough onto your floured work surface and knead until smooth. It should be medium-stiff consistency — definitely not firm, but not quite as soft as most bread dough either. Cover with a towel and allow to rest for 30 minutes to an hour.",

Rest the dough.  Divide the dough into 12 portions and roll each into a ball.  Set them on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and let rest at least 30 minutes (to make the dough less springy, easier to roll).￼5. You can either press your tortillas using a tortilla press lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking, which I used or you can roll them with a rolling pin using this method: On a lightly floured surface, roll out a portion of the dough into an even 7-inch circle:  Flatten a ball of dough, flour it, then roll forward and back across it; rotate a sixth of a turn and roll forward and back again; continue rotating and rolling until you reach a 7-inch circle, lightly flouring the tortilla and work surface from time to time. Make sure the tortillas are very thin, almost thinner than you think they should be.",
        "6. Heat an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle (you should hear a faint sizzle and see an almost immediate bubbling across the surface). After 30 to 45 seconds, when there are browned splotches underneath, flip it over. You will know it is time to flip when the edges look dry and lighter in color. Bake 30 to 45 seconds more, until the other side is browned; don’t overbake the tortilla or it will become crisp. Remove and wrap in acloth napkin placed in a tortilla warmer.  Roll or press and then griddle-bake the remaining tortillas in the same manner and stacking them one on top of the other."

        "This is my favorite stage of making bagels - placing them in a large pot of boiling water is what gives them their chewiness and the edge over many other any other bread rolls. Place the bagels on a fish slice or a perforated skimmer and lower them carefully into the pot of now boiling water. Allow them to cook for 1-2 minutes on each side before removing them from the water and placing them onto the prepared baking sheet(s). Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until they are golden brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack before serving up to your appreciative audience."

        "Place warm milk in the bowl of an electric mixer. Stir in the yeast and sugar. Add the butter, eggs, flour, nutmeg and salt. Beat the dough with the dough hook attachment (or with a wooden spoon and eventually your hands) for 2-3 minutes at medium speed. Adjust the dough texture by adding flour a few tablespoons at a time or more milk. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl and be very soft and smooth but still slightly sticky – don’t overflour! Knead the dough for a few minutes (again, by mixer or by hand) and then transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size (the exact time will depend on the temperature of your kitchen).",
        "Punch down the dough and roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness on a lightly floured counter. Using a doughnut cutter or a 2-3 inch circle cookie cutter, cut out circles in the dough. Carefully transfer the circles to a parchment- or silpat-lined baking sheet and stamp out the smaller inner circles using a smaller cutter. Be sure to make the holes large enough that as the doughnuts rise again and bake, they don’t fill in the doughnut hole with the puffiness of the dough. Cover the tray with lightly greased plastic wrap. (At this point, you can refrigerate the doughnuts overnight or proceed with the recipe.) Let the doughnuts rise for about another 45 minutes, until they are puffed and nearly doubled.",
        "Bake in a 375 degree F oven until the bottoms are just golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Start checking the doughnuts around minute 8. They should still be pale on top, not golden and browned, and just barely baked through.",
        "Remove the doughnuts from the oven and let cool for 1-2 minutes. Dip each one in the melted butter and toss or sprinkle with the cinnamon and sugar. Serve immediately."

Cut your potato into even slices, you will need 4-5 slices for the sandwich, then place them in your pan, cooking each side until browned and crispy.￼While cooking, salt and pepper the potatoes to taste (they don’t have to be too salty as the bacon with help with the saltiness as well) and sprinkle a light pinch of garlic powder. In another pan cook your bacon on medium heat to desired tenderness (I liked mine crispy for this sandwich!).￼While everything is cooking, slice your bread (use some crusty bread like french or sourdough if you have it), and generously butter the outside of each piece. On the inside, put about 1 tablespoon of sour cream on each slice as well as slices of cheddar cheese on each side. Once your potatoes and bacon are finished frying, dab them on paper towel to remove some grease, then fan the potatoes out on your bottom slice of bread, put a little more sour cream on top of the potatoes if you desire (I did to help the bacon and chives stick in the sandwich). Slice up one green onion stalk and spread it on top of the potatoes along with the bacon. Place your other slice of cheese on top of all of this and top with your bread!￼The greatness awaitsNow just grill the sandwich in a pan on medium heat until each side becomes golden brown. Once this is done, dig in and ENJOY!"

For a smooth and even frosting coverage, use a pastry bag and open tip to pipe a generous ring of the frosting around the top edge of the cake layer.

With an offset spatula, spread the remaining frosting evenly all over the cake, smoothing the edges. Place chocolate chips along the bottom of the cake for garnish. Serve or cover and store in the fridge for up to 2 days. Let come to room temperature for an hour before serving."

Pour mixture into a baking dish. Add bananas to a mixing bowl, sprinkle with brown sugar and toss to evenly coat. Stuff bananas into pockets in french bread slices. Dip one side of stuffed french bread slice in milk and egg mixture (I like to allow it to rest for a bit then gently squeeze excess out), being careful not to immerse banana filled center, then flip to opposite side to absorb mixture. Transfer to bowl of crushed cornflakes and coat one side evenly with cornflakes, then flip to opposite side and coat second side. Butter griddle and transfer prepared slice to griddle. Cook until golden brown on bottom. about 2 - 3 minutes, then lift slice, butter griddle again and flip to opposite side and cook until golden brown. Repeat process with remaining slices.

        "Stew will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days and freezes well.Ingredient note – Although Better Than Bullion provides great flavor, it a product I am trying to eliminate from my kitchen because of concerns with ingredients. The organic version is better than the regular version, which I don’t use, but the organic version does still have caramel coloring. Caramel coloring, although naturally derived, can be questionable. An alternative is to use Stock Options All Natural Beef Demi Glace. One of the most difficult areas to eliminate unhealthy ingredients is in condiments and other flavor enhancing products."

        "1. First make the aioli. Put the egg yolks, garlic, sea salt and lemon juice in a food processor and blend together until smooth. Keep the processor running on a slow speed and very slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream until it forms a thick sauce.",
        "2. Tip the aioli into a bowl. Add the chopped gherkin and spring onion and mix to combine. Set to one side.",
        "3. Remove any woody stems from the asparagus (do this by holding the asparagus spear in one hand about two thirds of the way down from the delicate tip. In the other hand hold it near the base. Gently bring your hands towards each other, bending the asparagus spear until it snaps. The lower portion is the woody stem and should be placed in your compost recycling).",
        "4. Steam the asparagus for 2 minutes then plunge into ice cold water to arrest the cooking process. Drain on kitchen paper.",
        "5. Now make the batter. Place the flour, corn flour, sea salt and beer in a bowl. Whisk together into a smooth batter. In a separate bowl whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Using a wooden spoon, add a quarter of the egg whites to the beer batter and stir gently to combine. Now carefully fold in the remaining egg white.",
        "6. Fill a large pan with the groundnut oil to a depth of 4 cm. Place over a high heat. It is important to get the oil to the right temperature before starting cooking so that the batter comes out crisp. The oil is ready when it is hot enough to turn a cube of bread brown within 30 seconds.",
        "7. Dip the asparagus spears into the batter, making sure they are fully coated, then place them carefully into the hot oil. Cook them in batches to prevent the oil temperature dropping too drastically when the asparagus is placed in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, turning to ensure an even golden brown colour. Serve hot with the lemon and garlic aioli and lemon wedges."

        "I like to keep some roasted garlic on hand.  It keeps in the fridge for a few weeks and it lets me use up a few heads that may have otherwise begun to sprout greens.  I see people cutting the tops off, pouring oil on and wrapping in foil, but really you don’t need to do any of that.  Just set your oven to 300º put the whole head of garlic on a tray in the oven and roast it for about 45-50 minutes.  When the skin begins to brown on top, it’s done. No oil, no mess.￼The aioli is as easy as just mixing the ingredients together.  It will be better as it sits, so it’s better to do this before you begin with the onion rings.  Just set it in the fridge.￼Slice your onions into 1/2” rings.  Pop out any layers that you think are too small for a good bite and store them for another use.  Separate the rings into a bowl or tray.￼There are two schools of thought for the pan that you will do the frying in.  One, use a really wide pan so you can fry more rings at a time or two, use a more narrow pot that will fill with less oil.  I went with the narrow pot, which was a bit limiting, but I was only making two onions worth and didn’t feel like using a quart of oil.  Get the oil in which ever you are going to use and get it hot while you make the batter.",
        "Since the batter is carbonated you want to be ready to use it right away.  It doesn’t go flat in minutes, but you don’t want it sitting around either.  Once your oil is hot, mix everything for the batter except the water.  Use only as much water as it takes to make a thin batter.￼Dip your onions in the batter and drop them individually in the oil.  They will sink to the bottom of the pot at first.  Use some tongs to knock them off the bottom and make sure they’re not sticking to each other.  As they begin to brown, flip them so they cook evenly.  Hold in a warm oven until they are all done.￼Garnish with parsley for color and serve with the smoked paprika aioli."

      "directions": [
        "For the Pie Dough:1. Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add in the chopped pieces of cold butter (cold is essential for a flaky pie crust). Blend together with your hands (or, alternatively, a food processor) until you have coarse crumbs (it doesn’t have to be perfect). You can use a pastry cutter, too, if you like.",
        "2. Place the dough back into the fridge for 15 minutes or so, so it stays cold. I don't always do this if I'm short on time, but if you can spare the minutes, it helps the dough a lot. Mix together the water and vinegar or vodka in a small bowl. When ready, slowly drizzle it over the dough, a tablespoon or so at a time, gently stirring the mixture with a fork or pulsing with your processor, until fully incorporated and the dough forms into a nice ball. You may not need all of the water. It might seem a bit too wet at this point, but it will dry up while it sits in the fridge.",
        "3. Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours or as long as overnight (obviously, overnight is best - I sometimes let this dough sit for 36 hours). Be sure to let your dough sit out at room temperature for 10 minutes or so before you start to roll it out.",
        "For the Pie:1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the blackberries, blueberries, sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice, lemon zest and cornstarch in a medium bowl, tossing to evenly disperse all of the ingredients. Let the fruit sit at room temperature while you roll out your pie crust.",
        "2. When you're ready, flour your work surface and roll out one ball of dough so that it's big enough to hang over the edges of your pie dish. To easily move the dough, fold it over on itself (see the photo above), then lift it into the dish and unfold. Trim the excess dough around the edges (and save to make cookies!), then crimp around the edge of your dish. Spoon your filling into the pie crust, then roll out the second ball of dough and place it on top, trimming the edges and crimping to stick to the bottom crust.",
        "3. Beat together an egg and a teaspoon of water, then brush the top of the crust with the mixture. Sprinkle generously with sanding or raw sugar, if you like. You can also cut out a decoration on top of the crust - I made a few circle cuts with the back of a metal frosting tip, but feel free to do whatever you like, or even use pie dough scraps to make a design and put those on top of crust, securing in place with some egg wash.",
        "4. Place your pie in the oven at 400 degrees F, then when it's in there, reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake for 45-60 minutes (depending on how hot your oven gets), keeping an eye on it in the last 10-15 minutes. If the crust starts to brown too much, create a foil cover for the pie or a foil ring around the pie dish to protect it from burning. Bake until the filling is bubbly and the crust is firm and golden brown. I like my crust just on the cusp of being burned, so I always stand in the kitchen for the last 10 minutes of the pie baking, watching carefully for the exact right moment to pull the pie out of the oven. It's worth it!"

There should be no visible pieces. This will take about 5-8 minutes.3.Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover with plastic, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size.4.While the dough is rising, make the filling.5.Place the blueberries, sugar and most of the water (reserve about 1 tbsp) into a pan and bring slowly to the boil. Boil the mixture for about 30 seconds, and then remove from the heat.6.Stir together the remaining water and the cornstarch, and then add this to the blueberries, stirring immediately.7.Place back on the heat and boil for about a minute. Remove from the heat, let it cool, and then puree the mixture, either with a hand-blender or in a blender. Chill.8.When the dough has risen, punch it down, and scrape it out onto a well-floured surface, pat the dough into a rectangle, about ½ inch (just over 1cm) thick, and cut out 9 donuts using a 2.5inch (5cm) round cutter, or cut into squares. Place the donuts on a lined baking sheet, cover with plastic again, and set aside to rise for another 45 minutes, or until puffy.9.When the donuts are finished their second rise, place about 2 inches of oil into a high-sided pan (or use a deep fryer), heat the oil over a low flame, until it reaches 350F/170C. Alternatively, place a small piece of dough in the oil, and when it bubbles and rises to the surface, the oil should be the right temperature.10.Fry the donuts a few at a time (don't crowd the pan) for about 1 minute each side or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Drain them on a rack, and then leave them to cool completely.11.When the donuts are cool, pipe them with a few tablespoons of blueberry filling.12.Crush the shortbread biscuits, and stir together the icing ingredients. Carefully dip the top of each donut into the icing, and sprinkle with the crumbs. Serve!"

        "4. In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until they are light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and scrape down the sides of the bowl and continue beating. Add flour mixture in portions still beating on medium speed. Beat in half of the milk-egg mixture, then beat in half of the remaining dry ingredients until incorporated. Add the rest of the milk-egg mixture, beating until the batter one. Add the last of the dry ingredients.",

        "7. For the Blueberry Syrup",
        "8. While cake is baking, make the fresh blueberry syrup. In a medium saucepan on medium-high heat, combine water and blueberries. Bring to a boil then add sugar and stir to dissolve. Allow to simmer for 20 minutes. Using a straining spoon, remove blueberries from liquid. Transfer to a small bowl and smash them and add the liquid to the saucepan. Add additional water or sugar to taste and allow to simmer another 5 minutes. Remove blueberry syrup from stove top and allow to cool.",
        "9. Once blueberry syrup and cake have cooled down, poke holes in the cake for the liquid. I used a turkey baster or meat injector to pour liquid in holes but a cup with a pour spout will work too. Pour blueberry syrup in holes until no more liquid is left then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
        "10. For the Whipped Topping",

Add powdered sugar, extract and lemon syrup. If using pre-made whipped topping, beat powdered sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract and whipped cream on low speed for 1 minute. Spread topping evenly over cake and place fresh blueberries on top for garnish.",

        "1. Place butter in the freezer for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.",

Use a spoon to toss the butter with the flour mixture, slightly chopping the butter into smaller pieces as you go. The mixture will have coarse crumbs. Place bowl in the freezer while you prepare the liquid ingredients. This will also allow the butter to stay frozen while you prep the dough.",
        "3. Whisk the egg, cream, and vanilla into a small bowl. Stir into the dry ingredients. Do not overmix. Gently stir the blueberries into the dough. Don’t worry if some of the blueberries break while you’re mixing the dough.",
        "4. Turn dough onto a floured surface and form into a ball. Flatten into a ¾-1 inch disk using your hands or a rolling pin. Cut in half, then cut each half into three pieces. Place onto a silicon baking mat or parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 12-16 minutes. The edges will be slightly golden. Cool on a wire rack.",
        "5. To prepare the glaze, whisk the powdered sugar with 1 tablespoon of orange juice. Add up to 1 tablespoon more to reach the desired consistency. I used about 1 ½ tablespoons of orange juice. You want the glaze to be thin and pourable, but not so thin that it gets soaked up by the scone.",

Bring to simmer, remove from heat and steep for about 10 minutes to infuse before removing the pod (if you’re using extract or paste, just add to milk, bring to simmer then remove from heat).",
        "2. In a bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale. Whisk in the flour until combined. While continuously whisking, add a bit of the hot milk to the eggs then pour the egg mix back into the pot.",

        "4. To make the caramel sauce, heat a deep heavy-based saucepan over low heat. Add the sugar in an even layer and leave to melt into a golden caramel. When it’s ready, take it off the heat and add a good splash of the cream (it’ll bubble up furiously so take care). When that settles, add the rest of the cream and the butter. Place it back over low heat and stir gently until everything has melted into a luscious sauce. Stir through the salt then cool.",
        "5. For the french toast, whisk the eggs, milk and sugar until frothy. Dip each slice of bread, both sides, into the egg batter until soaked. Heat up the butter in a pan then fry each side of the eggy brioche slices until golden then set aside.",
        "6. Sprinkle the banana slices, cut side up, with a little white sugar then blowtorch until golden and bruléed (feel free to torch the other side too if you wish).",

        "2. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the flour, salt, eggs, remaining sugar and frothy yeast mixture. Mix on low speed to combine then turn it up one notch and knead for 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then knead on medium speed for 10 minutes. Dough should be smooth and elastic.",
        "3. Add a couple of pieces of butter into the dough then after it’s incorporated, turn the speed to low and add the rest of the butter one piece at time, waiting until it’s mixed in before adding the next.",
        "4. When all the butter is in, turn up the speed and knead for at least 6 minutes, until the dough is very smooth, shiny, unsticky, elastic and comes away from the sides of the bowl perfectly (it’ll make slapping sounds while it’s kneading).",
        "5. Remove the dough hook then cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rise at room temperature (24°C) for about 2 hours until doubled in size.",
        "6. Knock the dough down a couple of times then cover tightly with cling film and refrigerate for at least several hours (not more than 24 hours). The dough is now ready to use.",
        "7. *At this point you could wrap the dough up well and freeze in an airtight container (to reuse, thaw overnight in the fridge and continue with the recipe).",
        "To make the loaves:1. Butter two medium-large loaf pans. Remove dough from the fridge and divide in half (dough will feel like cold playdoh). On a lightly greased or floured bench top, mould each half into a loaf shape then place in pans.",
        "2. Cover the tins lightly with cling film then leave to rise in a warm spot (no warmer than 24°C) for about 4 hours or until the dough has doubled in size (bread should feel light, soft and pillowy). It should rise to about 1cm below the rim of the tin and have a rounded top (bread will rise more in the oven).",
        "3. Meanwhile preheat oven to 175°C / 350°C and position the rack to the centre. In a bowl, whisk up 1 egg then gently brush the tops of the loaves from the outside in.",
        "4. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the loaves are deep golden and it sounds hollow when you tap the top of the breads (internal temperature should be around 190°F). Check after 10-15 minutes of baking. If it looks like it’s browning too fast, tent it with some foil then continue baking. Cool on wire rack for about 30 minutes then turn it out and cool completely.",
        "5. Brioche can be stored at room temperature, well wrapped in cling film for up to 2-3 days or in the freezer for a few weeks."

Immediately pour into a small, heatproof, bowl and allow it to cool until it is comfortably warm, not hot.In a small bowl combine yeast, water, and sugar and let sit for about 10 minutes, until foamy.Whisk together the flour and salt in a large bowl (or bowl of a stand mixer), and create a well in the center. Pour the foamed yeast mixture into the well.Using the paddle attachment on a stand mixer (or...just your hand mixer if you're like me and stand mixer-less) mix on low speed until combined. Add in eggs, one at a time, making sure each is fully incorporated before adding the next.On low speed, mix in the melted (or browned and cooled) butter and vanilla (if using). Beat together on medium speed for about 1 minute, until thoroughly combined. It will be thicker than a normal waffle batter but wetter than a bread dough.Place in a warm spot and cover loosely with a towel. Let rise for 45 minutes, until doubled.Gently fold in the pearl sugar and let rest an additional 15 minutes.Heat your waffle iron (mine doesn't have settings-if yours does start out with medium and use trial and error). Spoon about 1/4 cup of prepared batter onto the heated waffle iron and cook until evenly browned and crisped on both sides (my waffle iron sucks so I have to flip it half way through)-this should take 3-8 minutes. Use 2 forks to remove waffles from iron (CAUTION-the caramelized sugar is very hot, be cautious to avoid burning yourself or others).Top waffles with desired toppings and enjoy!If you have leftovers, store (plain) covered waffles in the refrigerator and, when ready to eat, place in a 300 degree oven for approx. 5-10 minutes, until warmed through and crisp!"

The combination of all the seasonings in flour mixture flavor the fish so well without overpowering it while the beer batter allows it to stay crispy. I’ve used the beer batter for onion rings as well and they stayed crispy even hours after they were fried! Serve the fish tacos with tortilla chips, beans, or even corn on the cob and enjoy a great summer meal."

Place a couple tablespoons of cheese and then about a tablespoon of bacon in each one and pinch shut tight to form a ball. Combine the warm water and baking soda in a bowl. Dunk each roll into the water. Place on a greased baking sheet and sprinkle with coarse salt. Use a serrated knife to cut a slit in the top of each roll.Bake for about 15 minutes or until browned (I divided them between two baking sheets, but you can do them all on one sheet probably if you don't mind them running together). Combine the butter, garlic, and paprika and microwave until the butter is melted. Then add the herbs (if you don't feel like it, you can just use plain butter without the herbs, garlic, and paprika). Brush the rolls with the butter as soon as they come out of the oven. Serve immediately."

Heat the same pan that the onions were cooked in on medium heat and add the hamburger patties. Cook about 4 minutes on each side or until desired doneness. About 2 minutes before the burgers are done cooking add 2 slices of cheese to each burger. Remove the burgers from the pan and set aside on a plate.",

Move the rolls around the pan so they absorb any leftover remnants from cooking the burgers. Cook until the bread starts to brown (about 3 to 4 minutes). Add the cheeseburger on the bottom side of the roll. Then add the onions, and the top side of the roll."

        "For a lazy weekend morning breakfast, you can do some of the French Toast preparation the night before.1.Make the batter and store it in the refrigerator in the blender container.▪Take the batter out 30 minutes before you begin and allow it to return to room temperature.▪Blend it again just before pouring it over the brioche.2.If you're using strawberries, the night before is also the perfect time to slice them and toss them with the sugar, and let them macerate in the refrigerator overnight.▪Take the strawberries out of the refrigerator before you begin, to allow them to warm to room temperature before serving.▪If you do macerate the strawberries the night before, they will release some of their juices. These can be poured over the Napoleon after you've added the final layer of berries, before you add the whipped cream.3.Prepare the glazed pecans the night before, if you're making them yourself.French Toast Variations▪If you can't find brioche, use thick slices of another rich sweet bread such as egg bread, challah bread, or Portuguese sweet bread.[4] If you use regular bread, make sure to leave it out overnight to dry out, so it doesn't fall apart when you soak it in the batter.▪If strawberries aren't in season, use whatever fruits are available, such as sliced peaches, plums or pears.▪Mix and match the fruit and nut combination, trying apples with glazed walnuts, bananas with hazelnuts, or even an apple, almond, and ginger combination.▪A richer French toast can be topped with fruit that's been macerated in a sweet liquid overnight.▪Consider soaking the fruit in vanilla syrup or in a liqueur like Chambord, Curaçao or Grand Marnier. This would also be a great use of leftover champagne. If you use a liqueur, you can also add a tablespoon of the same liqueur to the whipped cream to intensify the flavor.▪Sliced apples soaked in pumpkin spice syrup could be used for an autumn-themed French toast. If you try this, you may also want to ad 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the French Toast batter.▪If tropical fruits are available, consider a mixture of a few different fruits, like mango, banana, papaya, and starfruit (carambola). Softer fruits require less time to macerate, and very sweet fruits won't require much sugar at all.▪Additional flavors can be added to fruit while macerating. Try citrus juice or zest, or grated fresh ginger, or fresh chopped basil, or a dash of cayenne pepper.[9]▪To reduce the calories and fat in this Cheesecake Factory French Toast Napoleon recipe, substitute skim milk for the half and half, and 4 egg whites for 2 of the eggs. Top with light whipped cream and fresh berries that have not been combined with sugar."

      ],
      "directions": [
        "Combine 3 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp oil, 1 clove minced garlic, and half of the scallions into a resealable bag. Add chicken to marinade. Place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes up to 3 hours.Heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in wok or large pot over high heat for 2 minutes. Add chicken to the wok. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until chicken is mostly done and starting to brown on the edges. Remove chicken to a plate and set aside to cool. To the same pan, add the remaining tbsp of vegetable oil. Add shredded cabbage and carrots. Add remaining tbsp of soy sauce. Use tongs to “toss” the vegetables. Cook, over high heat, for about 2 minutes. Or, until cabbage begins to wilt. Toss in the bean sprouts, and cook for about 1 minute more. Off heat.Once cool, dice the chicken breasts and add them to the vegetables, mixing in well. Place a colander in your sink, or over a large bowl. Add egg roll mixture to the colander. Using several layers of paper towels, press down firmly on the egg roll filling, pressing out as much moisture as possible. Repeat process several times. Let filling cool for 30 minutes before rolling into wrappers.Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil in a dutch oven. I like to fry the rolls at about 375. While the oil is coming up to temperature, wrap the rolls according to the package directions.  Place into oil 4 or 5 at a time, turning over occasionally, until golden brown. Usually about 5 minutes. I usually add the rolls, wait one minute, then turn over with tongs. It seems like if you try to completely fry the first side, the gas released from the cabbage “blows out” the raw side, and then it doesn’t want to flip. I’ve found that a initial flip right from the get-go corrects that situation.Remove from oil with tongs, and place VERTICALLY into a large pot or casserole dish that has been lined with paper towels. This vertical drain is key, as it really helps the rolls not to become soggy.Serve with plenty of soy sauce, Chinese hot mustard, and duck sauce."

Bring the liquid to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low (try to maintain the temperature of cooking liquid to between 170°F and 180°F) and simmer until the chicken reaches the internal temperature of 160°F, about 15 minutes.",

Turn the mixer on low, then increase power to medium (watch out for splashing!) and mix until chicken is shredded to desired texture, about 30 seconds. (If you don't have a stand mixer, just shred the chicken using the two fork method, or my favorite, the \"bear claw.\") Return chicken to the poaching liquid to cool. Strain before using. Yields approximately 3 cups shredded chicken. (I made the chicken the night before so the flauta recipe came together in a flash.)"

        "Make the chicken fried steak: Cut steak into four pieces and tenderize with a meat tenderizer or use the back (the unsharp part of the blade) of a chef’s knife until the beef is flattened and nearly doubled in area. Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a wide, shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs and milk (I prefer the buttermilk option) in another wide and shallow bowl. Completely coat each piece of beef in the flour, then dip it into the egg and milk bowl, then coat it in the flour once again. Fill a cast-iron skillet or sauté pan with an inch of oil and heat over medium-high until a flick of the flour sizzles. Place the beef in the oil and let fry until blood begins to pool on the top of each piece. This takes a few minutes. Carefully turn the pieces to fry the other side for about 4-5 minutes more. Remove from the oil and place on a cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all of the steaks are cooked. Keep the rest warm in an oven until ready to serve.Make the cream gravy: Put the fat and flour together in a hot skillet or saucepan, constantly stirring until it becomes dark. This takes a few minutes. Slowly pour the milk into the pan while whisking it into the roux to break up any lumps. Turn the heat down to medium low and keep stirring until the liquid begins to thicken. This takes a few minutes, but it will happen. Season with pepper and salt to taste. If too thick for your liking, add a little milk to thin it out. Makes 1 1/2 cups.Serve the chicken fried steak with the cream gravy. Serves four."

      "directions": [
        "1. First, make your marinara sauce. Use a box grater to grate your onion into your pot or pan. Add in the olive oil, turn cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, until some of the liquid has evaporated. Add in the grated garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, sugar, red pepper flakes and your Parmesan cheese rind (this adds some salt and some cheesy flavor – I just grate my cheese ahead of time, then drop the remaining rind into the sauce. You can freeze used up Parmesan rinds to use for this purpose later on, too). Bring to a light boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or so. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
        "2. Now, prepare your chicken. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. I used 3 large chicken breasts, which I sliced lengthwise in half to make 6 cutlets. You can do this if your chicken breasts are thick, or you can place them between two sheets of parchment or plastic wrap and pound them out with a rolling pin. You just don’t want your meat to be so thick that it won’t cook through.",
        "3. In one shallow pan, combine your breadcrumbs, ½ cup of Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon black pepper and lemon zest. In another shallow pan, whisk together your two eggs. Heat your ¼ cup of olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy bottomed pan, then dip your cutlets in the egg, followed by dredging them in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing down to get the breadcrumbs and cheese to stick. Place the chicken in your pan, and cook on each side, until golden (about 3-4 minutes per side).",
        "4. When the chicken is ready, spoon about 1 cup of marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish (enough to cover the bottom). Arrange the cooked chicken in the dish, then top with the remaining marinara sauce. Add the sliced mozzarella cheese on top of each chicken cutlet, then sprinkle with 1 cup of Parmesan cheese. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes or so, until the mozzarella and Parmesan are fully melted and bubbling. Sprinkle with sliced basil or chives and serve with salad or on top of pasta."

Stir in the flour and pudding mix just until incorporated. Dollop the topping over the cake batter then use an offset spatula to spread into an even layer completely covering the cake.",

With refrigeration, the cake portion got hard and a little dried out. If you do have leftovers after the first day and want to refrigerate, I’d be sure to take the cake out with time to let it come back to room temperature before serving. Or, alternatively, a few seconds in the microwave helped."

Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip and carefully pipe about 1 to 1 1/2 inches of dough out over oil and using clean scissors, cut dough at top to allow dough to drop into oil (to make it faster I'd pipe about 2 - 3 inches out at time and would cut 2 at once then pipe more and repeat). Work in fairly small batches being careful not to overcrowd (which will reduce oil temperature too much. You want the oil to remain close to 350). Allow churros to fry until golden brown (stirring occasionally near the beginning of frying will help keep them from sticking to each other) and remove with a wire skimmer and drain on a plate or baking sheet lined with several layers of paper towels.",

Whisk the cornstarch with the flour (420 grams / 3.5 cups), and at to the wet ingedients, mixing thoroughly with a wooden spoon until all the flour is incorporated. Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in a warm place (I put mine in the oven and turn it on to 200 for about 1 minute every 30 minutes—if you do this, for the love of cinnamon buns, don’t forget to turn it off!) until doubled in bulk, about 1.5 hours. Push down and allow to rise again, 1.5 hours.",
        "2.Spread out a quarter cup of flour on a clean work surface (I just use the counter), keeping another quarter cup on hand if needed. You want to use as little flour as possible to form a rollable dough. The less flour, the more tender. Dump the dough out into the center of the flour and knead it in using your hands, adding additional flour if needed until you get a workable dough for rolling. Knead in flour *just* until you have a workable dough; don’t overwork it.",
        "3.Lightly flour a 20×20” square of your work surface, and roll out your dough into an 18×18” square, making sure it’s not sticking.",
        "4.In a small bowl combine the brown sugar and cinnamon.  In a separate bowl fully incorporate the rose water into the butter with a fork, and then gently spread the soft butter all over the dough, leaving about a 1” border. Sprinkle the brown sugar-cinnamon mixture on top and spread out evenly, maintaining the 1” border. Starting with the edge nearest you, roll the dough as tightly as you can. Pinch the seam very, very well to seal. You don’t want them popping open.",
        "5.Grease a baking pan with high sides (sometimes I use just a pie plate for a half batch and a Pyrex for a full batch). Using a floured knife or dental floss (works wonders!) slice the cinnamon buns about an inch and a half thick. Gently reshape them if they get a little smooshed and place them in your greased baking pan. Now you can either make them straight through, or cover them tightly with plastic wrap and allow to sit in the fridge overnight (up to 16 hours). Allow to sit out at least an hour or until rolls have doubled in size before baking. To make straight through, cover the rolls loosely and allow to rise in a warm place about 1.5 hours, until the rolls have doubled in bulk. In the last half hour of the rise, heat your oven to 325°F. Bake rolls on the middle rack uncovered for 25-35 minutes or until they reach an internal temp (I stick a digital thermometer in them) of 190°F. This way I can bake them just to doneness and maintain their gooey, soft texture without undercooking. Allow the rolls to cool for 10 minutes in the pan.",
        "Make the icing and ice the rolls:1.Whip one cup of powdered sugar into 1/2 cup of creme fraiche until fully dissolved. Add more creme fraiche as needed to adjust consistency. Drizzle this all over your cinnamon buns while they’re still warm so it gets down in the crevices. Now it’s time to eat them with a big glass of – naturally – local milk if you can get your hands on it!"

        "Dough:Add the yeast to warm water and stir to dissolve. Leave for a few minutes until it begins to froth, then transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Add 120g of the flour, sugar, salt, beaten eggs and the hot milk and mix on a low speed for a few minutes until the dough has come together, then add another 180g of flour and turn the speed up a bit until it’s been incorporated. Finally add the melted butter and the remaining 180g flour and knead the dough for around 5 minutes. The dough will be super sticky and elastic, but panic not! Scrape (literally) the dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to rise in a warm spot for an hour.After an hour of proving, tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and with your hands, knead in the sultanas. Work the dough for 5 minutes or so until it is springy and pliable, and doesn’t stick to the work surface. Shape the dough into a ball, place back in the bowl, cover and leave to rise for another 30 minutes.",
        "Filling:After the second prove, take the dough and roll out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it into a rectangle around half an inch thick and transfer to a sheet of parchment paper. Spread the softened butter over the entire surface of the dough. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon then sprinkle it gently dump it all over that beast of glory and spread evenly. NOTE: the amount of sugar in this recipe results in oozing, sticky, delicious cinnamon buns. If you’re not into that, then please click the top right button… or left if you’re on a Mac.Roll the dough away from you into a log and sit seam-side down. Cover with a clean dish towel and leave to rise for another 20 minutes – I know, the suspense is killing me too. Preheat the oven to 200°c to pass the time.",
        "Bake:FINALLY – it’s time. Slice the dough-log-thing almost all of the way to the bottom, leaving about an inch between each slice. You should get between 10 and 12 slices. Then arrange each cut section so that they lean to alternate sides. Brush the dough all over with the beaten egg. Slide the parchment paper with the cinnamon buns onto a baking sheet.Bake in the middle of the oven for 20-25 minutes until puffed up and golden and oozing and until the house smells so damn good you literally can’t handle life any more.

It takes less time than you'd think).",

Fill each muffin cup generously with your batter (I filled mine almost to the top). Sprinkle the tops liberally with raw or granulated sugar, then bake for 15-20 minutes, until the tops are a nice golden brown and the muffins are set. Allow to cool before removing from the pan. If any of the grapes oozed out and stuck the muffin to the pan, simple run a butter knife around the edges to remove the muffins.

In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes until fluffy and pale yellow in color. Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula. On a lower speed, add the egg to incorporate. Increase the speed back up to a medium-high for 1 to 2 minutes until the sugar granules fully dissolve and the mixture is a pale white color. On a lower speed, add the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix 60-75 seconds until your dough comes together and all remnants of dry ingredients have incorporated. Your dough will still be a slightly fluffy, fatty mixture in comparison to your average cookie dough. Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula.",

The dough won’t end up covering the entire pan, this is okay. Bake the oat cookie for 15 minutes. Cool completely before using in the crack pie recipe.",
        "To prepare the pie filling, mix the dry ingredients for the filling using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on low speed. Be sure to keep your mixer on low speed during the entire process of preparing the filling; if you try to mix on any higher than a low speed, you will incorporate too much air in the following steps and your pie will not be dense and gooey – the essence of the crack pie. Add the melted butter to the mixer and paddle until all the dry ingredients are moist. Add the heavy cream and vanilla and mix until the white from the cream has completely disappeared into the mixture. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the egg yolks to the mixer, paddling them in to the mixture just to combine. Be careful not to aerate the mixture. Use the filling immediately.",
        "To assemble the pies, preheat the oven to 350°. Put the oat cookie, brown sugar and salt in the food processor and pulse it on and off until the cookie is broken down into a wet sand. (If you don’t have a food processor, you can fake it till you make it and crumble the oat cookie diligently with your hands.) Transfer the cookie crumbs to a bowl and, with your hands, knead the butter and ground cookie mixture until the contents of the bowl are moist enough to knead into a ball. If it is not moist enough to do so, gently melt an additional 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and knead it into the oat crust mixture. Divide the oat crust evenly over 2- 10″ pie tins.",
        "Using your fingers and the palm of your hand, press the oat cookie crust firmly into both 10-inch pie shells. Make sure the bottom and the walls of the pie shells are evenly covered. Use the pie shells immediately or, wrapped well in plastic, store the pie shells at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
        "Place both pie shells on a sheet pan. Divide the crack pie filling evenly over both crusts (the filling should fill the crusts 3/4 way full) and bake at 350° for 15 minutes. During this time, the crack pie will still be very jiggly, but should become golden brown on top. At 15 minutes, open the oven door and reduce the baking temperature to 325°. Depending on your oven this will take 5-10 minutes – keep the pies in the oven during this process. When the oven temperature reads 325°, close the door and finish baking the pies for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the pies should still be jiggly in the bull’s eye centers, but not in the outer center circle. If the pies are still too jiggly, leave them in the oven an additional 5 minutes.",
        "Gently remove the baked pies from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool at room temperature. You can speed up the cooling process by transferring the pies to the fridge or freezer if you’re in a hurry. Freeze your pie for as little as 3 hours or up to overnight to condense the filling for a dense final product – the signature of a perfectly executed Crack Pie. Just before serving finish with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar.",

        "I would halve the entire recipe, not just the filling portion, right off the bat (no one needs two of these laying around, nor do you “need” the extra cookie portion; unless you have the freezer space for it or company or are training for a triathlon, halving is my recommendation)I would use a 9-inch, not 10-inch, pie plate as she recommends. I felt it was just “barely” enough filling and don’t attribute it to halving the recipe. I also used more than half the cookie for the crust and feel a 9-inch would be better.I would underbake the cookie crust by about 25-30% of what she recommends (take it from 15 minutes to about 10 minutes) so that it crumbles easier and packs into the pie plate easier; plus it gets baked a second time anyway as part of the pie.I would consider buying a store-bought graham cracker pie crust and just making Christina’s filling if I wanted to take this recipe from 2 hours of standing on my feet to 15 minutes by just making the filling.I didn’t miss the corn powder and would continue to use my 1 1/2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour because I am frugal, didn’t want to source it, and don’t want to store a bag of corn powder in my already maxed out cupboard space for the occasional one tablespoon use of it.Tosi recommends baking the entire pie, crust and filling together, for 15 minutes at 350F, opening the oven door and allowing the oven to cool to 325F, and then baking for about 5 more minutes after the oven temperature has reached 325F (about 20-25 minutes of total baking time). I needed to bake mine for about 31-34 minutes of total baking time in order for the center to set (at least one-third longer than she called for which is highly significant and to be noted). Also I was only baking one pie; if I had two in the oven, it would have taken even longer."

If your chicken breasts are not fairly uniform in size place them between two pieces of wax paper and gently pound them out with a meat pounder until they are more uniform in size. This will help with even cooking times. Pat chicken breasts dry with a paper towel.",
        "Season the chicken with salt and pepper and then dredge into the flour, dip in buttermilk, and then dredge again in the seasoned flour and deep-fry the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Turn the chicken breasts during the cooking to make sure that both sides of the chicken are golden brown. This should take 7 to 8 minutes for each one to cook. When the chicken is done drain in a wire wrack."

        "￼In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the beer or seltzer, flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. The batter will bubble at first, then settle.￼Pour the panko breadcrumbs into another bowl. Have an empty plate handy for the breaded fish.",
        "Dip each piece of fish into the batter. When you pull the fish out of the batter, let the excess batter run back into the bowl.￼After dipping in the batter, gently roll each piece in panko crumbs to coat. Leaving too much batter on the fish will lead to clumping, so make sure your fish is only lightly coated with batter before breading. Place the breaded fish onto the empty plate.￼When your fish is breaded, heat 1/2 inch of cooking oil in a skillet over medium high. Fry the breaded fish pieces in batches of 6. If the oil is at the correct temperature, it should bubble and sizzle evenly—no splatters or popping.￼Flip the fish when they turn dark golden brown. It will take 2-3 minutes per side for the fish to become golden and crisp.￼While the fish fries, whisk together your sauce ingredients. Reserve the sauce.￼Place fried fish pieces on a wire rack to drain, if you have one. This will keep the fish as crisp as possible. Use paper towels to catch the oil drips underneath the rack. If you don’t have a wire rack, you can drain the fish pieces on a double layer of paper towels.￼When all the fish pieces are fried, assemble your tacos. Heat the corn tortillas in a skillet till they become warm, fragrant, and flexible. Place 2 pieces of fried fish in each taco. Top with a bit of shredded lettuce, some diced tomato, 2 slices of avocado, and 1 tbsp of sour cream sauce. Serve warm with fresh lime wedges."

        "Stir together cold mashed potatoes with both cheeses and diced jalapenos. Scoop 48 tablespoonfuls of the potato mixture and set them on a parchment or wax paper lined baking sheet. Refrigerated for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, place tortilla chips in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to fine crumbs, or place chips in a large zip top bag and smash using a rolling pin. Pour crumbs into a shallow bowl. Beat the eggs and pour into another shallow bowl. Finally, pour the flour into a shallow bowl. Set aside. Heat oil in a fryer (or Dutch oven) to 350 degrees. Remove mashed potato scoops from refrigerator and roll into balls. Roll each mashed potato ball into the flour, tapping off excess. Once all of the potatoes are coated in flour, dip each into the egg, allowing excess to drip off, then into the tortilla chips, making sure to coat them evenly with crumbs. Set on a clean baking sheet. Discard any excess flour, egg and tortilla chips crumbs. Fry small batches of the mashed potato poppers in the hot oil until golden brown, 30-40 seconds. Remove from fryer and place on a paper towel to drain off excess oil. Repeat. Serve hot with sour cream, if desired. Poppers can be reheated in a 350 degree over for 6-8 minutes."

        "Ok let’s get started with the dough. Ideally you do need an electric stand mixer as it is a very wet/sticky dough to start with.Put the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the salt & sugar to one side and the yeast to the opposite.Beat together the eggs, water and milk.TIP! If it’s too cold, pour into a saucepan over a very low heat, stirring constantly until it is tepid. (Meaning, if you can’t tell whether it’s hot or cold, it’s tepid.)Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix on a low speed for 2 minutes until all the ingredients are mixed together.Then mix on a medium speed for a further 6 minutes.￼Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball. Dust it all over with flour then place into a large plastic bag. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour.￼Meanwhile, take the block of cold butter and bash it with a rolling pin until it is a rectangular sheet measuring approx 33 x 19cm. Wrap in clingfilm and place back into the fridge to solidify whilst the dough is still resting.Once the hour is up, take the dough out of the fridge and roll to a rectangle measuring approx 50 x 20cm. (About 1cm thick.)￼Then take the butter rectangle and place it over the bottom 2 thirds of the dough.￼Fold the top third over (so it overlaps half of the butter.)￼Then carefully cut the exposed butter off – without cutting the dough underneath it and place on top of the dough you just folded down.￼Now fold the exposed third of dough, up over the top of the butter.￼Pinch the edges together lightly to seal and place back into the bag. Pop into the fridge again for another hour.When the hour is up, remove the chilled dough and place on a lightly floured surface with the short side towards you.Roll out into a rectangle the same size as before. (about 50 x 20cm.)￼Fold the bottom third up…￼Then the top third down…￼This is a single turn. Place back into the bag and into the fridge for another hour. Repeat this ‘single turn’ step 2 more times. (Always starting with the short side towards you.)After this, dust lightly all over with flour, place back in the bag and rest in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight. Then your dough will finally be ready to use!Tic toc tic toc…Whilst time is ticking on, make the creme patissiere.Whisk the sugar, egg yolks & cornflour together in a bowl until smooth then set to one side.￼Oh, and those spare egg whites? Don’t waste them! Pop them in a bag and freeze them so you can make some meringues or marshmallow later. Waste not want not!￼Pour the milk into a large, heavy base saucepan. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds and put into the milk along with the empty pods.Bring it to the boil then remove from the heat.￼Pour about a quarter of the milk onto the egg mixture and whisk until there are no lumps.￼Pour this back into the pan with the rest of the milk and cook over a gentle heat, whisking constantly.￼The mixture will become like a thick custard.Once this happens, immediately remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir for a minute so it doesn’t catch on the bottom.￼Pass the creme patissiere through a sieve then stir in the butter to melt through.￼Spread it over a baking sheet and cover with cling film, making sure the film actually touches the surface of the creme patissiere. This will stop a skin from forming. Place in the fridge until needed.￼I told you it was a labour of love! Right. Now the dough has had time to rest properly and the creme patissiere is completely chilled, we can assemble our pastries.VERY IMPORTANT! With laminated (layered) doughs/pastries, never roll it up into a ball and roll out as you will lose all those beautiful layers you’ve spent so long putting in. Halve the dough and roll out one of them to a rectangle with a long side towards you. Spread half of the creme patissiere over it leaving a clear 5cm margin on the long edge nearest to you. (I made a mistake here and didn’t leave enough room. Making it difficult for myself to roll as you can see in the photos below.)￼Evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips over the creme patissiere then ‘tack’ the long edge nearest you to the worktop.￼Take the top edge and carefully roll it over. Continue to roll towards you, pulling away from you a little each time to create a little tension. When you have reached the tacked edge, gently roll the dough backwards & forwards to seal the join.Trim the edges then cut the roll into 12 even portions.(Again, I made a mistake and only cut 6 like a plonker! I rectified it later but it was far more difficult than if I had just cut 12 at this stage. It also made them a little misshapen. Doh!)￼Repeat the process for the other flavour only adding the chopped apricots instead of chocolate chips.￼Lay the pastries cut side up on lined baking sheets. Allow a bit of room between each one for spreading.￼Cover with large plastic bags and prove for about 2 hours until at least doubled in size.About 30 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C.￼Brush the pastries all over with the beaten egg then bake for about 15-20 minutes until a deep golden brown on top. Turn the trays round halfway if necessary to ensure an even bake.While the pastries are baking, Warm the apricot jam in a saucepan with a little water to make a thin, runny glaze.￼As soon as the pastries are out the oven, brush them all over with the glaze and allow to cool. At this point, they will start to look very sexy…￼When they are cool enough to handle, transfer the pastries to a wire rack to cool completely whilst we make the icings.For the chocolate icing, simply put the icing sugar in a bowl or jug, add the water and mix until it becomes smooth and thick.For the lemon icing (to go on the apricot pastries) put the icing sugar in a bowl or jug, add the water and the grated zest of 1 lemon and mix until it becomes smooth and thick.All that is left for us to do now is to drizzle the icings over the pastries in a ‘haphazard’ manor and allow it to set.￼Now take a step back and applaud your masterpieces.￼Ok, so it’s taken pretty much 2 days to make them, the list of ingredients is as long as my arm and they were pretty fiddly to make. But look at them. Look at that beautiful golden shine, those gorgeous pockets of apricots and melted chocolate chips… all finished with a beautiful drizzling of runny icing. Wasn’t it all worth it? I guarantee they will taste better than any of those horrifically dry pastries you get at the supermarkets. They somehow never fail to disappoint me. But these babies, particularly on the day of baking, are absolutely divine! They’re moist, oozingly sticky & just down right fantastic!"

        "1/4 c butter, melted (1/2 stick)",
        "1/2 c brown sugar",
        "1/3 c white sugar",
        "1 egg",
        "1 c flour (plus more as needed, see directions)",
        "1 c whole rolled oats (plus more as needed, see directions)",
        "1/4 tsp (heaping) baking soda",
        "1/4 tsp (heaping) baking powder",
        "3/4 tsp cinnamon",
        "1 tsp vanilla extract"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 350F.  Combine rum and raisins in a small bowl and set aside.  In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter.  Add the sugars to the melted butter and whip by hand with a spoon until mixed.  Allow mixture to cool a bit before adding the egg (just cool enough so you don’t end up with scrambled eggs) and stir.  Then add all remaining ingredients & stir.  Finally, fold in the soaking raisins and rum, including any rum that did not absorb into the raisins and was at the bottom of the bowl.Examine your batter and based on how well your raisins did or did not soak up the rum, you may need to add more flour/more oats if the batter is looking too wet.  My raisins did a poor job of soaking up the rum so I added another 1/4 c flour and another 1/4 c oats to get the batter into cookie dough consistency.  Use common sense and judgment. Also, chilling the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking will help with wet dough and chilled dough will result in cookies that spread less while baking.Scoop golf ball sized balls onto a cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart.  They do spread. Bake at 350F for 10-12 minutes.  Remove from oven even if they don’t look quite done; they will solidify more as they cool.  Allow to cool well before removing the cookies from the cookie sheets."

        "1. If you are using active dry yeast, combine the yeast in the water and let sit for 5 minutes. For instant yeast, you can just combine the yeast with the dry ingredients.",
        "2. In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a kneading hook, combine 1 cup of the flour, cornmeal and instant yeast (if using instant). Add the water (or yeast/water if using active dry yeast), olive oil and honey or sugar. Stir until moistened. Add more flour in 1/4 cup increments until you achieve a soft dough that is neither sticky or stiff. Remove dough to a well-oiled large bowl and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour.",
        "3. While dough is rising, prepare the pizza sauce. Empty the can of tomatoes into a mixing bowl and coarsely crush the tomatoes with a fork or your hands, leaving them just a little chunky. In a heavy bottom 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Add the onions and saute until slightly translucent. Add the garlic and saute about a minute until golden. Add the crushed tomatoes. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the fresh basil and oregano. You can add a touch of sugar if tomatoes are tart. Simmer on a low, stirring often for at least 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool at room temperature until needed.",
        "4. While sauce is simmering, cook your sausage and bacon. If your sausage is links in casing, cut a slit down the casing and remove the sausage from the casing. Discard casing. Cook sausage in a skillet, breaking up into small pieces with a spoon, until cooked and browned. Set aside until needed. Cook bacon and crumble.",
        "5. Preheat oven to 425° F. Grease the bottom and sides of cast-iron frying pan with olive oil and lightly dust with additional cornmeal.",
        "6. When dough is ready, scrape onto a well-floured surface (dough will seem sticky at this point, but will be fine with the additional flour on the counter. With a rolling pin, roll dough into a circle a little bigger than the bottom of your skillet. Transfer dough to prepared cast-iron frying pan and press into bottom and up the sides about half way up. Cover bottom of pizza completely with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. Top with sausage and then bacon. Top with all of the pizza sauce and sprinkle top generously with freshly-grated Parmesan cheese. *You don’t want your crust to extend too much higher than your filling, or the exposed part at the top will overcook. If it extends too high once your filling is in, push or crimp it down to closer to the level of your filling.",
        "7. Bake in pre-heated 425° F. oven for about 30 minutes. Check at 30 minutes. If crust is dark enough, cover loosely with a sheet of tinfoil and cook 5 -10 minutes longer, to be sure the crust is cooked. Remove from oven and allow to cool in pan for 5 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully remove pizza to a cutting board and cut into pieces with a sharp knife."

        "For the dough:",
        "▪2 cups all-purpose flour",
        "▪1/2 tsp. salt",
        "▪1/2 tsp. baking powder",
        "▪1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes",

        "▪5-6 tbsp. salted butter, cut into cubes for easy melting",
        "▪1/2 cup cold whipping cream (I used 36%)",
        "▪3/4 tsp. salt"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "For the dough:In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking powder. Once well mixed, add in butter a few cubes at a time, massaging into the dry mixture with your hands until you get the texture of wet sand. Mix in sour cream and knead dough together until well combined—the dough will be very wet and sticky at this point.Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface, working and kneading the dough until it comes together, adding more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough is too sticky to handle.Roll the dough into an 8×10-inch rectangle* and dust with flour before folding it into thirds as if you were folding a letter.Rotate the dough 90º and roll it out again into an 8×10-inch rectangle. Fold the dough again into thirds, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for 30 minutes while you make the filling.*If you have trouble visualizing sizes, picture a regular sheet of paper. When the dough is rolled out, it should look about the same size.",
        "For the filling:Toss together apple pieces, lemon, cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Mix until all apple pieces are well coated. Add in flour to thicken the mixture. Set aside until ready to use.",
        "Making the pies:Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and carefully unfold it onto a lightly floured surface, rolling it out into a 14×14-inch square. Using a palm-sized circular cookie cutter or glass, cut out as many circles as you can from the dough. Gently remove the circles to a dry work space, then re-roll out remaining dough and continue the same process until all the dough is used up.Place 6 circles on a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or parchment-lined baking sheet, and spoon in a small portion of the apple filling. Be careful not to overfill because the dough could rip in the process. Place a second dough circle on top of the filled circles, then crimp the edges using a fork to seal the exterior.Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the top of each pie with the egg wash. Cut 3 slits in the top of each pie with a sharp knife, then sprinkle a small pinch of sea salt on top of each one. Bake pies for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool on the baking sheet or on a wire cooling rack for 5 minutes.￼",
        "For the caramel sauce:Add sugar to a medium-sized saucepan on low heat. Stir frequently with a rubber spatula to prevent burning. After 2-3 minutes, you should notice that the sugar will begin to clump together and melt. Once all the sugar is melted down to a golden-liquid, add in butter cubes and stir with spatula until all the butter has melted and it is well mixed with the melted sugar. Next, add in the cold whipping cream—the temperature difference will make the sauce sputter a bit, don’t be alarmed! Allow to boil for 60 seconds or so, then remove from heat and stir in the salt. Drizzle over the cooling pies and you’re ready to eat!**"

      "notes": [
        "**If you plan on serving the pies later, store them in an airtight container for 3-4 days. You can re-heat the caramel sauce and drizzle it on top of them before serving."

Turn off heat, open the oven door and let crullers sit for 5 minutes before removing and glazing. For those that are frying these, line a plate with paper towels and place next to the saucepan containing the oil. Place one or two crullers at a time into the oil, paper side up. Remove parchment paper from the hot oil using kitchen tongs. Fry crullers two minute per side, remove from the oil and place onto prepared paper towel-lined plate to get rid of excess oil. Transfer to a wire rack to let cool. Repeat with remaining crullers.",

Continue whisking until the mixture is thick and creamy (about the consistency of thin gravy) or if you have an instant read thermometer it should read 160 degrees F (71 C). Do not overcook it or it will get lumpy.",
        "7. Use a towel or oven mitt to remove the bowl from the pot, then whisk in the lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasonings to taste. The Hollandaise Sauce needs to be used immediately or it will clump. If you need to hold it, you can periodically warm it in the double boiler while whisking to maintain a constant temperature between 150 and 160 degrees F.",
        "8. To assemble your Eggs Benedict, put the toasted English Muffins on plates, top with a slice of ham, top with a poached egg, then finish with a generous blanket of Hollandaise Sauce. Garnish with paprika and serve immediately."

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold over itself a few times. Form the dough into a ball and place into an oiled bowl. Turn the dough around so it is totally covered in oil. Then cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm place and let rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes.3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a sheet pan with cornmeal or with a baking mat or parchment paper. Remove the dough from the bowl and place back onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out into an oblong shape until it is about 1/2-inch thick. Place the dough onto the baking sheet. Using your index finger, poke deep holes on top of the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 15 minutes.4. To prepare the topping, stir together the olive oil, rosemary, and the garlic cloves in a small bowl. Remove the plastic wrap. Use a pastry brush and brush the mixture all over the top of the bread. Sprinkle some extra salt on top. Bake for about 15-20 minutes on the bottom rack until golden.

Heat for 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Caramels should be fully melted and you should have a smooth caramel mixture. Add rice cereal and mix together. Spread caramel mixture evenly over the brownie layer and place pan into the freezer.4. For the nougat layer, combine butter, sugar, and evaporated milk in a medium saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and continue to simmer the mixture for 10 minutes without stirring. Meanwhile, combine marshmallow cream and peanut butter. Pour the warm nougat into the marshmallow mixture and whisk to combine. Spread evenly over the caramel layer and return pan to the freezer.5. Finally, combine chocolate chips, butter, and whipping cream for the chocolate layer. Melt in 30 second increments until smooth and creamy. Pour chocolate over the nougat layer and spread in an even layer. Place in the fridge and let cool until set, about 3 hours. Cut into bars and serve."

        "Bring the water, butter, sugar, and salt to a brisk boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir in the flour all at once and continue stirring until the flour is completely incorporate. Keep stirring over medium-high heat. Lara says the more moisture you can remove, the more eggs you can mix in later which will result in a lighter pastry. When you see a thin film start to coat the bottom of the pan, the batter is ready. Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer. Use the paddle attachment to stir the dough for a minute to help it cool. Turn the mixer to medium speed and add one egg. Don’t add the next egg until the previous has been completely incorporated into the dough. Then add the egg whites a little bit at a time (I used two egg whites) until the dough becomes smooth and glossy and holds a little shape (not much). Lara warns not to add too much egg white or else the crullers will become heavy. Transfer the dough to a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip.Fry the crullers in 2-inches (or more) of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. The oil should register 370°F. While the oil is heating, cut a dozen 3-x3-inch squares of parchment. Lightly grease the squares on one side (I brushed with vegetable oil) and pipe a ring of dough onto each of the squares. When the oil has reached temperature, carefully place a cruller, paper-side up, into the hot oil. Do this one at a time unless you like the idea of hot oil burns and other disasters. After a minute or so, I would use tongs and a sharp knife tip to gently peel the parchment off the cruller. When the cruller turns golden (about 2 minutes), flip it over and let it fry for another couple of minutes before removing it to drain on a cooling rack or paper towels.Make the glaze: While the crullers cool, mix the confectioners’ sugar, honey, and milk together until smooth.When the crullers are cool to the touch, dip the top of each cruller into the honey glaze and set on a cooling rack to let the drips run off. When the glaze has set, the crullers are ready to serve.Crullers can also be baked. Preheat oven to 450°F. Pipe crullers onto a parchment-lined baking sheet at least 2-inches apart. Bake for five minutes then reduce oven to 350°F and bake another 15 minutes. Turn off heat, open the oven door a crack, and let crullers sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Glaze and serve."

        "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",

Place the bread slices on a cookie sheet or rimmed baking sheet, slightly overlapping, and let them dry in the oven for 15 minutes. Turn the bread and bake for another 15 minutes. The object is not to toast the bread, but to thoroughly dry it out. But, a little golden color is fine. Remove the bread from the oven.",
        "3.To assemble: Choose a deep 9” by 13” baking dish. Mix 4 tablespoons of melted butter and ¾ cup of brown sugar together. Spread the brown sugar and butter mixture into the bottom of the baking dish. In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon. Divide the loaf of bread roughly into three parcels, with one a little smaller for the bottom layer, and one a little larger for the top layer. Place one layer of bread into the bottom of the baking dish. Cut whole slices of bread as necessary to cover the bottom. Sprinkle half of the sugar mixture on the bottom layer. Add a second layer of bread, cutting slices as necessary to fill the dish. Sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture onto this layer. Finally, place the remaining bread in the dish for the top layer.",
        "4.Blend together the eggs, milk, cream, and vanilla. Blend (or whisk) until there are no visible traces of yolk. Using great care, slowly pour the custard over the bread. The bread will absorb the liquid. Be sure to get all of the top layer wet. Use a spatula to lightly press down on the top layer to ensure that it gets soaked with the custard. Secure plastic wrap over the casserole dish and place it in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and as long as overnight.",
        "5.Prior to baking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the dish from the refrigerator to allow it to warm up for at least 30 minutes.",
        "6.To prepare the topping: Mix the softened butter, brown sugar, maple syrup and pecans together. Distribute the topping evenly over the top of the casserole. Place the casserole on top of a sheet of aluminum foil and lift the edges. Place the casserole into the oven, ensuring that the foil is under it to prevent dripping. Bake until the middle of the casserole has an internal temperature of 170 degrees, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. The casserole will puff up significantly during baking. Remove the dish from the oven and allow it to rest for 20 minutes prior to serving. Expect it to deflate a bit during this period."

        "Bacon Cheddar Green Onion Waffles:1. Preheat waffle iron.2. In a large bowl stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt and black pepper. Make a well in the center of the bowl and set aside.3. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk together. Pour into the center of the dry ingredients. Add the melted butter and buttermilk. Using a wooden spoon, stir the waffle batter until just combined. It should be sightly lumpy. If the batter appears to be too thick, add a splash of buttermilk and stir until pouring consistency is reached. Fold in the cooked chopped bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, and sliced green onions.4. Lightly grease the waffle iron with cooking spray or melted butter. Pour in about ½ cup batter in each waffle cavity, more or less depending on size of waffle iron. Cook until the waffles are golden brown and crispy. Mine were about 4 to 6 minutes. Place the cooked waffles on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Place in a 200° F oven to keep the waffles warm until ready to eat. Continue cooking until all the batter is used up. Serve warm with maple syrup or maple mustard sauce (recipe follows). Or make them into fried chicken and waffle sandwiches (recipe follows). Waffles will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days. To rewarm, place the waffles on a baking sheet in a 300° F oven for about 5 minutes until crispy. Enjoy!",
        "Buttermilk Fried Chicken:1. Place the chicken in a large bowl. Cover with buttermilk and add the hot sauce, if using. Toss together until evenly mixed and all the chicken is submerged in the buttermilk. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. If you don’t have the time, this step is not crucial but it will help make the chicken tender and juicy.2. In a shallow dish combine the flour, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and black pepper. To coat the chicken, grab a piece from the buttermilk bowl, slightly drain off, and throw into the flour. Pat the flour into the chicken, on both sides. Return to the buttermilk bowl (with the rest of the chicken) and coat both sides. Place the chicken back into the flour, once more, and coat both sides. We’re double dipping the chicken. Lay  the coated chicken on a rack placed over a baking sheet. Repeat in this manner until all the chicken is coated. Allow the coated chicken to rest for at least 10 minutes, this will allow the fry to dry a bit and stick to the chicken.3. In the meantime, heat about 2 inches of oil in a heavy duty pan, such as a cast iron skillet. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken in batches. Cook for about 5 minutes on the first side, turn over once golden brown and crispy, continue to cook for another 4 minutes on the other side. Drain the chicken and place on a separate rack set over a baking sheet. You can keep the cooked chicken warm in a 200°F oven until all the chicken is fried and you’re ready to serve. Make into fried chicken and waffle sandwiches with bacon cheddar green onion waffles (recipe above) and layer with lettuce, sliced tomato, avocado, and maple mustard sauce (recipe follows). Enjoy!",

        "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "1) For the pastry: This is the same recipe as my homemade pie crust. See step-by-step photos if you need visuals for making the pastry. I usually make the pastry the night before. First, mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold unsalted butter and shortening. Using a pastry blender or two forks, cut the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal (pea-sized crumbles with a few larger bits of fat is OK). I use a pastry cutter for this step. It’s easier, less messy, and quicker. If you do not have a pastry cutter, use two forks. But buy one – they are an inexpensive addition to a baker’s kitchen. Measure 1/2 cup of water in a glass. Add ice. Stir it around. Slowly drizzle in the very cold water 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring with a large spatula after every Tablespoon of water that you add. Do not add any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to clump.",
        "2) Roll out the dough on a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Form the dough into a ball. Divide in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks).",
        "3) Assemble the pop-tarts: Remove 1 chilled dough disc from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. This will help make the dough easier to roll and work with. Keep the other disc in the refrigerator. After 15 minutes, place disc onto a lightly floured work surface, and roll it into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick and 9x12 inches in size. Trim the sides as needed. Always be gentle with your pastry dough. You don't want it to tear. Cut each piece of dough into thirds and each third into thirds again. You will end up with 9 rectangles, each measuring 3×4 inches. Use a ruler to help make this process easier and more accurate.",
        "4) Place each of the 9 rectangles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. The pop-tarts will not spread in the oven much, so you may place them relatively near one another. Place the baking sheet in the fridge. Roll 2nd disc out into a rectangle and cut into 9 even rectangles like you did with the first half of the dough. These nine rectangles will be the tops of your homemade pop-tarts. Place the baking sheet into the refrigerator as you make the brown sugar cinnamon filling.",
        "5) Make the filling: Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour together in a small bowl. Set aside. Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl until combined. Remove 1 baking sheet of rectangles from the refrigerator. Brush egg wash over the entire surface of teach rectangle. These will be the bottoms of your pop-tarts and the egg wash will help glue the lid on. Place a heaping Tablespoon of the prepared brown sugar filling into the center of each rectangle, spread it around, leaving around 1/4 inch of space on the edges. Brush the second baking sheet of rectangles with egg wash, then place each rectangle on top of the filling-topped rectangles - egg wash side down. Use your fingertips to press firmly around the pocket of filling, sealing the dough well on all sides.",
        "Poke holes in the tops of each filled pastry to allow the steam to escape. This helps get your pop-tart pastry nice and flaky. I used a toothpick to poke 8 holes in each. Seal the edges by crimping with a fork, to prevent the sides from opening as the pop-tarts bake. Refrigerate the filled pop-tarts uncovered for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. This chilling let the pop-tarts rest before baking. It also firms up the pastry, since it has been out at room temperature for so long at this point.",
        "Preheat oven to 350F degrees.",
        "Once unbaked pop-tarts have chilled for 20 minutes, remove from the refrigerator and brush the tops with the remaining egg wash. This egg wash will give your pastry that beautiful golden sheen. Bake for about 22-28 minutes or until they’re golden brown, rotating the pan halfway through baking. Let the baked pop-tarts cool on the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before glazing.",
        "Make the glaze: whisk all of the glaze ingredients together in a medium bowl until it reaches a spreading consistency. You want a thick glaze, but not too thick that it is hard to spread. Add another teaspoon or two of milk if needed. Use a spoon or knife to glaze each pop-tart. The glaze will slightly harden in about an hour, if you prefer to wait that long.",
        "STORING & FREEZING. Store pop-tarts in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for 6 days. To reheat, bake in a 350F degree oven for 10 minutes. Baked pop-tarts freeze well, up to 3 months. Thaw and reheat as directed before. I am unsure about reheating in a toaster."

      "notes": [
        "*Get creative! Use your favorite fillings instead of brown sugar cinnamon. Like jam, Nutella, etc.",
        "*I'm sure store-bought pastry would be fine, but this homemade version creates that unique flaky, slightly crunchy yet tender texture you know and love from regular pop-tarts. I prefer shortening in my pie crust and pastry dough recipe for the best texture. Feel free to use your own favorite pie crust recipe that uses all butter if you prefer. Butter may not be replaced for shortening in this particular pastry recipe."

While the lard or oil is warming, beat the egg yolks until lemon color and frothy.￼Whisk in the milk.￼Sift together 3 cups of the flour, the baking powder and the salt. Sift this into the milk and egg mixture and beat to form a batter. The batter should be similar in texture to a thick pancake batter. If the batter seems too thin, add some of the remaining flour until thick. I ended up adding about 4 cups of flour total.￼Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.￼Gently fold into the batter.￼You will need a funnel with a 1/2 inch opening on the spout to control the flow of your batter.￼Take about ½ cup of batter and pour it into your funnel, stopping the funnel hole with your finger till you're ready to pour.￼Drizzle the batter into the preheated oil, starting at the center and rapidly moving in circles in an outward motion; this will create “coils” of cake. Work quickly, since the cakes take only a minute or two to cook. You can become as creative as you like and make all sorts of exotic shapes once you learn to master the funnel.￼Flip the cake delicately using tongs or a slotted spoon/spatula.￼Continue to fry till golden brown.￼Once the cakes turn crispy and golden, lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on a rack or paper towels.￼Continue filling the funnel and frying cakes in this manner until all the batter is used up. Cook the cakes one at a time, otherwise the batter will lower the temperature of the oil and turn the cakes soggy. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve.",

After 5 minutes, the yeast will begin to bubble if it’s active. When the bubbles start to form, continue making the recipe. If the yeast does not activate, try again with a new envelope of yeast—but make sure the water is not too warm.",
        "2. Meanwhile, combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Pour in milk, melted butter and beaten eggs. Stir just a few times to begin mixing the ingredients, then add in the activated yeast mixture. Mix until a cohesive dough ball forms. If you’re using a stand mixer, mix the dough on medium speed for 5 minutes. If you are mixing by hand, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for approximately 10 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.",
        "3. Place the dough ball into a mixing bowl lightly coated with non-stick spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap then allow the dough to rest in a warm place for 1–1½ hours until it has doubled in volume.",
        "4. When the dough has doubled in volume, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface then roll into a 15\" x 16\" rectangle. Brush the inside of a 4½\" x 8½\" loaf pan and the entire surface of the dough liberally with melted butter. You won’t use up the entire 3 Tbsp of melted butter but don’t let that keep you from a generous application. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the 16\" side of the dough into four 4\" wide strips, then cut five 3\" strips in the opposite direction. You should have twenty 4\" x 3\" rectangles.",
        "5. Sprinkle the inside of the buttered loaf pan and the dough rectangles generously with garlic salt followed by the Parmesan and cheddar cheese.",
        "6. Next, prop the loaf pan onto its end so that you can stack the rectangles on top of each other inside the pan. Use a spatula to move the cheese-covered rectangles from the board into the pan. There should be no need to compress them, so just stack them until they completely fill the pan. Once the cheesy dough is in the pan, turn it back right side up and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise one more time in a warm spot for about 1 hour. Meanwhile place a baking rack in the center of the oven then preheat to 350 degrees.",
        "7. Bake for 35–40 minutes or until the cheese has become crispy and brown and the center of the loaf is cooked all the way through. Remove from the oven and brush the loaf with the remaining melted butter. De-pan the bread and immediately start chowing down on this cheesy salty garlicky treat!"

      ],
      "notes": [
        "Let's talk about the boiling.  Boiling the pretzels for about 30 seconds makes the interior of the pretzel quickly “puff” and begins the crust formation. If you don’t boil, you’ll lose out on the chewiness you’d expect from a pretzel.  You find this same principle with bagels.",
        "Baking soda is very alkaline ingredient.  Sometimes it is mixed with flour and combined with an acid in baked goods, where it neutralizes the acid, creates carbon dioxide bubbles, and causes the baked good to rise. In this case, it is bathing the exterior of the pretzels, so the purpose is different.  We are not trying to increase the rise of the pretzels, we are increasing the alkalinity of the outside of the pretzel.  Here, the alkaline water allows browning of the pretzel to occur at a lower temperature (thanks to the Maillard reaction, for all of you science buffs).  By allowing the browning to to happen more easily, you don't have to bake the pretzel nearly as long to achieve the brown exterior. So if you baked the pretzel long enough to get the brown color on the outside without the alkaline environment, you would impact the texture significantly. So basically, the baking soda gives the pretzel the brown, shiny crust and imparts a distinctive flavor and aroma as well. ",
        "So what happens if you skip the “boiling in water + baking soda” step?  Your texture, flavor, and appearance will all be rather anemic.  Without the alkali bath, you would basically just have a cute bread stick. So go for it.  It does not increase your prep time by much, and it's awfully fun to see the water bubble up when you add the baking soda. ",
        "I tried to research the history of the pretzel, which I assume originated somewhere in Germany. I found this story from The History of the Pretzel on kitchenproject.com.... (which basically means that we really are not sure of the origins except that this is a pretty ancient food):",
        "The pretzel may have originated as early as 610AD at a monastery somewhere in Southern France or Northern Italy, where monks used scraps of dough and formed them into strips to represent a child's arms folded in prayer. The three empty holes represented the Christian Trinity.  The monks offered the warm, doughy bribe to children who had memorized their Bible verses and prayers. The monks called it a Pretiola, Latin for little reward. From there, the pretzel transformed into the Italian word, Brachiola, which means little arms. ",
        "The Pretiola journeyed beyond the French and Italian wine regions, hiked the Alps, wandered through Austria, and crossed into Germany, where it became known as the Bretzel or Pretzel. ",
        "In medieval times merchants traveling to the Frankfurt Fair risked being robbed by bandits. In order to guard the tradesmen, the towns' people would ride out, greet the vendors and offer them pewter pitchers of wine and loads of crisp dough on their spears, called Geleit-pretzels.",
        "The Whimsical Pretzel shape worked its way into the culture not only as a reward but as a symbol of Good Luck and prosperity. I suppose it had the same effect as a logo did appearing in festivals and celebrations, as well as a quick snack available from street corner vendors. Probably two of the most fascinating things about the pretzel is it was served on Easter with 2 hard boiled eggs and hidden around the farms, for the kids to find. This very likely was the forerunner of the Easter egg hunt. Weddings in Europe for a time used the tradition of the bride and groom tugging at a pretzel like a wishbone, the larger piece assured the spouses fulfillment of their wishes."

      "notes": [
        "1. You need to use starchy potatoes for hash browns as they breakdown when cooked, becoming nice and fluffy on the inside and golden and crunchy on the outside. The best to use are Russet (common in the US), dutch creams, King Edwards or red delight. However, great all rounders like golden delight, coliban, red rascal and Sebago (popular in Australia) still works great. ",
        "I use Sebago which are the brushed potatoes you can get from any supermarket in Australia (ie. the ones with dirt on them). If you are based in the US, a great all rounder to use is Russet which I understand is one of the most widely used potatoes in the US. ",
        "2. This can be made up to an hour in advance, then reheated in a hot oven (200C/390F) and it will be crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. If you make it any further ahead then you might notice some loss of moisture on the inside, but the outside will still be nice and crisp when reheated in the oven. I have made it the night before, stored it in the fridge then to reinvigorate it, just drizzled a bit of olive oil on it before popping into the oven."

        "2. With the mixer still running, add the butter piece by piece, until it is all worked in and incorporated. There should be no visible pieces. This will take about 5-8 minutes.",
        "3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover with plastic, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size.",
        "4. When the dough has risen, punch it down, and scrape it out onto a well-floured surface, pat the dough into a rectangle, about ½ inch (just over 1cm) thick, and cut out as many as you can using a 2.5inch (5cm) doughnut cutter, or a round cutter and a piping nozzle if you're me. Re roll the donut holes and scraps and keep going until all the dough is used.",
        "5. Place the donuts on a lined and lightly floured baking sheet, cover with plastic again, and set aside to rise for another 45 minutes, or until puffy.",
        "6. When the donuts are finished their second rise, place about 2 inches of oil into a high-sided pan (or use a deep fryer), heat the oil over a low flame, until it reaches 170C. Alternatively, place a small piece of dough in the oil, and when it bubbles and rises to the surface, the oil should be the right temperature.",
        "7. Fry the donuts a few at a time (don't crowd the pan) for about 1 minute each side or until they are golden brown and cooked through.",
        "8. Drain the donuts on paper towels or on a wire rack, and leave to cool for at least 10 minutes.",
        "9. To make the glaze, whisk all the ingredients together in a wide, shallow bowl, until smooth. Add a little more liquid if the glaze is too thick.",
        "10. Dip the donuts into the glaze, turning to coat them on all sides, and place them back onto a wire rack to drip and set slightly. Or just start eating them straight away! Serve with a black coffee!"

You’ll need 2-3 inches of oil. If you have a thermometer, heat oil to 375° F. Without a thermometer, test oil heat by dropping a bit of batter in. It should float, sizzle immediately, and turn golden within a minute or so.",

In a small saucepan, bring the water and white granulated sugar to a boil over high heat then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 1 minute. Add this mixture to the bowl with the icing sugar and whisk until all the sugar and has been incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Dip cooled fritters in glaze or drizzle/brush glaze over and return to cooling rack set over a baking sheet to catch any drips. Allow glaze to set and enjoy!",

Add 2 1/2 cups of the flour (saving the last half cup for kneading), salt, and olive oil. If using a stand mixer attach the dough and need the dough on medium speed for 8 minutes, adding more flour until you have a smooth dough. If using your hands sprinkle a little of the extra flour onto your clean work surface and turn out the dough. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or the work surface, but try to be sparing. It's better to use too little flour than too much. If you get tired, stop and let the dough rest for a few minutes before finishing kneading.",

        "4. Gently deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and gently flatten each piece into a thick disk. Using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces into a circle 8-9 inches wide and about a quarter inch thick. Lift and turn the dough frequently as you roll to make sure the dough isn't sticking to your counter. Sprinkle with a little extra flour if it starting to stick. If the dough starts to spring back, set it aside to rest for a few minutes, then continue rolling. Repeat with the other pieces of dough. (Once you get the hang of it you can be cooking one pita while rolling the next one out.)",
        "5. Warm a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat (you want a hot pan). Drizzle a little oil in the pan and wipe off the excess.Lay a rolled-out pita on the skillet and bake for 30 seconds, until you see bubbles starting to form. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side, until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Flip again and cook another 1-2 minutes to toast the other side. The pita should start to puff up during this time; if it doesn't or if only small pockets form, try pressing the surface of the pita gently with a clean towel. Keep cooked pitas covered with a clean dishtowel while cooking any remaining pitas.",
        "6. These are best eaten fresh, but will keep in a ziplock bag for a few days or in the freezer."

        "Preheat the oven to 325.  Put the flour in the Reynold’s oven bag and shake it around to distribute it.  Place the pork roast into the bag and set it inside of a shallow glass baking dish.  Sprinkle the garlic salt, cumin and oregano over the roast.  Top with the green chiles and onion slices.  Add the water to the bag.  Fasten the bag with the fastener and cut six slits in the top of the bag to allow the steam to escape.  Bake the roast at 325 for about 3 hours or until the pork is very tender.  Remove the pork from the bag, and place the liquid and vegetables in a large bowl.  Shred the pork and add it to the bowl.  Add the salt, pepper, pimentos, green onions, sour cream, and half of the cheese.  Mix well.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350.  Pour 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9 x 13 glass baking dish.  If your tortillas were stored in the refrigerator, you will want to warm them in the microwave so that they will be more pliable.  Using a pastry brush, spread about 2 teaspoons of enchilada sauce on each tortilla.  Top each with about 2/3 cup of the pork mixture.  Roll up the tortillas and arrange them, seam side down, in the baking dish.  Top with the remaining enchilada sauce.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.  Cover the baking dish with foil.  Bake at 350 for 55 minutes or until the enchiladas are thoroughly heated."

Add the seasonings, vinegar, tomato paste and chicken broth. Let the sauce simmer and low boil until it begins to thicken. As the sauce is reducing, roast the red bell pepper. To do this, place the bell pepper on a cookie sheet and lightly spray with cooking oil. Place the pepper in the oven on broil and let the pepper cook until the top is charred and has several black spots on the skin. Do this to the other side of the pepper and then remove from the oven. Place the blackened pepper into a plastic bag or brown paper sack to sweat. This will help the skin peel off easier. Once the pepper is no longer too hot to touch, peel off the blackened skin and cut into large pieces.",

Blend the sauce until it is smooth. As you are blending the sauce, pour in the heavy whipping cream and continue to blend. You can serve the sauce this way, or if you would like a creamy version of this sauce, add the mayonnaise to the sauce. This sauce is great for these tacos, on salads, on sandwiches or anything else you can think of!",

Add the chicken and the other vegetables and let it warm up until the cheese begins to melt. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with a little Mexican cheese and drizzle with the ranchito sauce. Serve warm and garnish with cilantro."

DO NOT put the uncooked bacon into the crock pot. The bacon grease will ruin the chili.￼This step is purely optional. I brown the turkey before I put it in the crock pot. It's more work and more dishes so feel free to skip this part if you like.￼Lay the bacon on some paper towels. Use a couple paper towels to pat it dry.

        "1. In a large bowl combine the chopped peppers (red, green and orange), chopped celery, garlic and onion, if using (I typically leave the onion out). Set aside.",
        "2. In a small to medium size bowl combine the oregano, thyme, basil, creole seasoning, chili powder, cayenne pepper, pepper and salt. Set aside.",
        "3. Before you begin the next step, make sure you have completed steps 1 and 2. It is very important to have all your ingredients prepped and ready go.",
        "4. Grab a seat. No literally, grab a sit. You cannot walk away from the roux over the next 20-30 minutes. Heat a large heavy bottom soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the canola oil and flour to the pot and whisk to combine. Stir the roux EVERY 15-25 SECONDS. You will be able to smell the flour starting to brown. Continue to gently brown flour without burning it until the mixture turns the color of peanut butter or a dark caramel. This can take 30 minutes or so but it is the heart of the recipe. If you burn it, start over. This time just keep stirring and keep an eye on it! It took me 25 minutes to achieve a dark peanut butter color.",
        "5. Once you have your roux made, add all your vegetables (everything in the bowl). The roux will bubble and thicken up immediately into a paste which coats the vegetables. Let the veggies cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring every couple minutes or so. Sprinkle spice mixture over the vegetables, stir and cook 3-5 minutes longer.",
        "6. Add chicken broth, chicken thighs and sausage to the pot. Bring the gumbo to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for at least 3 hours or up to all day (the longer the better for flavors to blend). The gumbo should be the consistency of stew. If too much of the liquid evaporates add water to thin and if there is too much liquid leave the top off the soup and cook 30 minutes longer. Once the meat has cooked through, skim fat from top and lightly shred the chicken. Serve over rice and sprinkle with file powder (sassafras powder) if you have it. Beer Bread is great with this meal!"

Blend until very very smooth.￼Feel free to strain the sauce to get out the thickest pulp and the seeds (makes a smoother sauce). Adjust with water to your desired consistency.￼The recipe makes about 2 cups, which I divided into a 12 ounce jar and a 4 ounce jar. The bigger one I put in a hot water bath for 10 minutes to seal for another time, and the little one I put in the fridge. Hopefully I can find an awesome little bottle to put this stuff in eventually, but for now it’ll be available for any day I realize my face hasn’t been burned off enough."

I just prefer the oven method because I found the coating was getting too dark in the pan before the chicken was cooked through- the oven method solves this issue."

        "1. Make the dough: In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir it around a bit and let it sit for about 2 minutes. Add the milk, melted butter, sugar, eggs, salt, and 3 cups of flour. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes (using a dough hook if you have a stand mixer or using a hand mixer). By hand add enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. About 5 cups total.",
        "2. Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Do not over-knead, which will yield a tough, chewy bread. The dough is ready when it is smooth and when you can poke it with a finger and it springs back. Form dough into a smooth ball and place into a large greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. I greased the bowl with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.",
        "3. Make the coating: melt 1/2 cup of butter in a small bowl. Mix granulated sugar and cinnamon together in another small bowl. Set aside. You will use the rest of the butter, brown sugar, and vanilla later.",
        "4. Spray a 10-12 cup bundt pan with cooking spray. Set aside. Punch the cold dough down very gently to allow the air bubbles to release. Pull apart pieces and roll into balls, about 1.25 inches in diameter. You will need 40-45 balls total, so be modest with their size. Dip each ball, one by one, in the melted butter and then generously roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat them. You may need more cinnamon-sugar depending how heavy you coat each ball. Arrange them in the bundt pan as you go. If you did not use Red Star Platinum yeast, cover the pan and allow dough balls to rise again for about 45 minutes at room temperature. If you did use Red Star Platinum yeast, move ahead to the next step and bake right away.",
        "5. Preheat oven to 350F. Melt the remaining 1/4 cup of butter and whisk in the brown sugar and vanilla until combined. Pour the buttery mixture over the dough balls in the bundt pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top. Cover loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly. Cool for 5-10 minutes and invert onto a large serving plate.",
        "6. Top with the glaze. Simply whisk all of the glaze ingredients together and pour over the bread. You may either cut the bread into generous slices or let everyone pick off the gooey pieces themselves. Monkey bread tastes best served on the same day, but will stay fresh for 3 days if stored covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator."

Work on a low speed until everything is combined and the dough gathers up around the dough hook. Remove the dough hook, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave in a warm spot for about an hour or until doubled in size.",

        "4. To shape the hotteok, lightly flour your hands and pick up a piece of dough. Flatten it out gently into about a 4 inch circle, and cradle it in your open hand. Place two teaspoonfuls of the filling (roughly one eighth) into the middle of the dough, and then carefully bring the edges of the dough into the middle pinching them together until the filling is covered and the edges of the dough are completely sealed. Continue until all the hotteok are shaped.",
        "5. To cook the hotteok, heat a heavy based frying pan over a medium-low heat until warm. Add a very small amount of oil to the pan (a flavourless oil is best) and swirl to coat. Place two hotteok at a time, seam side down, into the pan and cook until the are very light golden brown. Flip them over and squash them right down, so that they spread out in the pan, and are no more than about ½ inch thick. Cook until dark golden brown on that side, and then flip and cook until the first side is a dark golden brown too.",
        "6. When all the hotteok are cooked, you can either eat them as they are (be careful not to burn your mouth!) or you can slice them open and fill them with a fat scoop of vanilla ice cream, and then eat them with about a million napkins as the ice cream melts creamily into your hot pancake. YUM."

You can do this on the barbeque (medium-high), or even just roast the skins using the element on your stove. Once the jalapenos are done roasting, put them in a ziploc bag or bowl covered with saran wrap to allow the humidity to help separate the skin from the flesh of the jalapeno.￼Peel the skins off the jalapenos, slice them in half, take the spine and seeds out, then chop them up. If you have dehydrated tomatoes and chives on hand feel free to chop some up to add to the potato mixture.For the potato mixture, mash up your potatoes, add the cream cheese, margarine and cheese, mixing until smooth, adding milk as necessary to get your desired texture. Once this is done, mix in the jalapenos (I threw some seeds in for extra kick!), dehydrated tomato, chives along with salt and pepper to taste. Once you have everything mixed together, take an ice cream scoop (or a spoon) and form small patties until the mixture is used up.￼Once you have all the cakes formed, get three dishes for the flour, egg and panko. Dredge the potato cakes in the flour, then the egg and finally the panko. Once everything is breaded you can FINALLY get to cooking! If you have a deep fryer then you can most definitely use that, but I just cooked them in a pan (on medium-high heat) with enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook each side until browned and serve!￼If you are a dipper, then I definitely recommend serving with some ranch, which I thought complimented the cakes nicely! Since this recipe makes quite a few cakes, you can refrigerate them for a couple days or freeze them and cook as needed!"

Add half of the flour and set mixer with whisk attachment and blend until smooth. Switch mixer to hook attachment, slowly add remaining flour and knead on low speed until smooth and elastic about 4 - 5 minutes, adding additional flour as needed (I only added about 2 Tbsp more. You shouldn't need a lot more, you want dough to be slightly sticky and tacky but shouldn't stick to a clean fingertip). Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until double in size, about 1 1/2 hours.",

        "Heat shortening in a cast iron dutch oven to 360 degrees (don't walk away from oil while preheating and don't let it get above 375 degrees, remove from heat and reduce heat as needed). Meanwhile, prepare glaze by mixing together all of the glaze ingredients in a shallow dish (don't add too much water, you'll be dipping warm doughnuts in glaze so you don't want it to be runny, fairly thick is good). Carefully transfer doughnuts to oil (I could fry 3 at a time) and fry until golden on bottom, then using a wooden chopstick, flip to opposite side and fry opposite side until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool 1 - 2 minutes then dip top half in glaze while still warm and return to wire rack and allow glaze to set at room temperature. Best served warm. Once cool reheat in microwave 5 - 10 seconds if desired."

        "-Preheat the oven to 350°, and line a 11 x 7 x 1 ½” baking dish (or even a 9 x 9”) with enough foil so that there is an overhang (makes for easier lifting/removing of the cooled bars), and mist lightly with cooking spray.-To prepare your crust, add all of the crust ingredients to a bowl, and using your fingers or a fork, combine until all the crumbs are well coated in the melted butter; pour the crumb mixture into the prepared foil-lined baking dish, and press them using the back of a measuring cup to create an even layer of crust; set aside.-To prepare your filling, add the softened cream cheese, along with the lemon zest and juice, into the bowl of a food processor, and process until smooth; add the sugar, the eggs and the vanilla, and process again until completely blended and smooth; pour the filling over the prepared crust, and smooth out the top.-Bake the cheesecake bar mixture for about 30-35 minutes, or just until the center of it still slightly jiggles; remove from oven and allow it to cool for 30 minutes.-Place into the fridge and allow to completely chill for at least 3 hours (or even overnight, ideally) to set.-Once cooled and set, lift the cheesecake out with the overhanging foil; spread the Sweet Vanilla Bean Sour Cream over the top, then cut into 12 equal bars. (You can let the sour cream “set” just a bit in the fridge for 30 minutes before cutting into bars, if desired.)-To finish, drizzle/pipe some of the Lemon Curd over the top of the bars decoratively, and sprinkle with a little edible gold “dust”, if desired.-Serve bars cold.",
        "Sweet Vanilla Bean Sour Cream:-Add the sour cream to a bowl; next, split the vanilla bean pod down the center, and scrape the paste out of it; add it to the sour cream.-Add in the powdered sugar, and gently whisk the ingredients together just until blended; cover and refrigerate until ready to use.",
        "Lemon Curd:-In a medium-size bowl, combine the sugar with the lemon zest, and using your fingers, work the zest into the sugar.-Add the whole eggs, the yolks and the juice, and gently whisk to combine.-Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method), and using a spatula, carefully and continually stir the mixture for about 6-8 minutes, scraping the sides and the bottom of the bowl to prevent scrambling (it’s alright if you have a little scrambling), or until it becomes thickened and has a pudding-like consistency.-Strain the curd into a clean bowl, then cover with plastic wrap directly touching the curd, and cool completely in the fridge. (This recipe makes enough curd for the bars plus lots extra to enjoy swirled into plain Greek yogurt, spread on toast, spooned onto ice cream, etc. So delicious!! Keeps for about 2 weeks in fridge when covered.)"

In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine the marshmallows and butter and heat on high power to melt, about 90 seconds. Keep a watchful eye because the marshmallows will grow and swell to the top of the bowl. Immediately upon removing the bowl from the microwave, stir vigorously for about 10 seconds to combine the butter and marshmallows. Add the Malibu and stir to combine. Add the cereal, one cup at a time, and toss to coat. (I wanted to keep these gooey so I suggest not more than 6 cups of cereal, possibly only 5. I used about 5 1/2 cups) Pour mixture into prepared pan and lightly pack it down and smooth it with a spatula; set aside.In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate on high power, about 45 seconds. Stop to stir and heat in 10-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred smooth, taking care not to scorch the chocolate, noting that white chocolate scorches very easily. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the bars with a spoon. Garish with sprinkles before chocolate sets. Place pan in the freezer for about 1 hour or until bars have set up before slicing and serving. Because of the alcohol in the Malibu, these will take a bit longer to set than traditional Krispy Treats to set up. Store bars in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. I prefer them chilled and store them in the freezer"

Using a donut cutter or a 3 inch and a 1 inch circle cookie cutter, cut out the donuts and carefully transfer them onto a lined cookie sheet.

        "1. Stir together the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often, until the it reaches 240 degrees F on a candy/fat thermometer. Be careful not to let the mixture bubble over - turn the heat down if you need and keep a watchful eye over it. This might take a little longer than you think, but just keep at it. Mine took about 10 minutes, but when you're standing there watching it, it feels like an eternity. It got stuck at around 220 for what seemed like forever, but then it eventually got up to 240.",
        "2. Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Start whipping the egg whites to soft peaks on medium speed. You want to have the egg whites whipped and ready to go, waiting for your syrup to be drizzled in. If they’re whipping faster than your syrup is coming to temperature, just stop the mixer until the syrup is ready, which is what I did.",
        "3. When the syrup reaches 240 degrees F, reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly drizzle about 2 tablespoons of syrup into the egg whites to warm them. If you add too much syrup at once, the whites will scramble. Slowly drizzle in the rest of the syrup, a bit at a time - seriously, do not do more than 2 tablespoons at a time.",
        "4. Increase the speed to medium high and whip until the marshmallow fluff is stiff and glossy, about 7 solid minutes. Don't try to speed this process up! Add in the vanilla and whip 2 minutes more. Use the fluff immediately or refrigerate stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. I made my fluff about 4 hours ahead of time, stored it in an airtight container and served it on its own with graham crackers and chocolate later in the day at a barbecue."

Heat over medium heat until the butter is melted, then add 2 tablespoons water. Cover and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until the apples are starting to soften.",

Line a baking sheet with paper towels and an upside-down wire cooling rack (see Deep Frying 101, page 188).",

Add a bit of water, and cook on medium to low heat until the onions are tender, and the corn and beans are heated through.",

        "Heat a pot of oil on the stove to a medium high heat. Now it’s time to begin wrapping as the oil heats up.￼Take a spring roll wrapper, with a point facing you, and add about four tablespoons of the mixture about two inches in from the nearest point to you. Fold over, tucking the mixture in, and begin rolling. When you have about 3 inches remaining, brush the egg mixture on the top most area, and on the sides. Fold over each side, tighten, then do your final roll. Make sure the roll is sealed by gently rubbing the final roll area, and making sure the egg mixture, or what I call the glue, adheres to the wrapper.",
        "Repeat until the mixture is done. This makes about 12 egg rolls.",

        "Let these sit a few minutes as they are really pretty hot from frying. When you are ready to serve, place them on a serving plate, and serve with your favorite guacamole and fresh salsa. Trust me when I say this, these are rockin’ and did not last long when served. The sweetness of the corn, balanced with the subtle heat from the chilies, and the creaminess of the beans, made this perfect when topped with the guacamole and fresh salsa. Enjoy."

        "Shape the dough into a rough ball and transfer to large clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. You can also let the dough ferment in the fridge overnight. Remove from the fridge and let come to room temperature, about 2 hours, before using.",
        "Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface. Divide into 2 equal portions. Take one portion of dough and gather 4 corners to the center to create 4 folds. Turn seam side down and roll into an even ball. Repeat with remaining half of dough. Let the dough rest, covered, until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes.",
        "At this point the dough can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Unwrap and let rest at room temperature, covered in plastic, for 2 to 3 hours before shaping. Freeze the dough, individually wrapped in plastic and placed in ziptop bags, for up to 1 month. Defrost in the fridge overnight then allow to sit at room temperature as directed before shaping.",
        "Place a baking stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat to 450°F. Place one ball of dough on a large sheet of parchment and shape and stretch until you have a thin 12-inch circle. To get the dough super thin, briefly roll with a rolling pin. Slide the dough onto a pizza peel or flat cookie sheet. Cover with a clean towel until ready to use. Brush the edges with olive oil and top with desired toppings. Bake in a 450°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until desired doneness."
      ],
      "notes": [
        "White Whole Wheat Flour:This flour is 100% whole grain and just as nutritious as regular whole wheat flour, but has a lighter taste and color due to the fact that it’s made from a naturally occurring albino wheat. This makes it absolutely perfect for pizza dough. I’ve seen this at most grocery stores in either the King Arthur brand or Gold Medal brand. This recipe uses all white whole wheat flour but tastes wonderful, promise.",
        "SAF Instant Yeast:This is my favorite yeast that I keep in the fridge since it’s such a large package. It’s instant yeast, which means you don’t have to proof it by combining with water for 5 minutes. You can add it directly into your dough recipe with the other dry ingredients, no special treatment required. You can find other brands of instant yeast, sometimes called “rapid-rise.” If you only have active dry yeast, combine it with the 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 115°F) in the recipe and let stand for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy and dissolved. If this doesn’t happen that means your yeast has expired and is no longer usable.",
        "Extra-Virgin Olive Oil:A splash of oil goes into the dough to give it richness and a boost of flavor, then we brush the edges of the stretched dough with some more olive oil before topping. This ensures the dough gets nice and golden brown and crispy. Don’t skip the brushing! Another tasty option is to combine some melted butter with minced fresh garlic cloves to brush around the edges of the dough for a garlic butter crust. YUM.",
        "Flavorings:Fine sea salt gives the dough some flavor, as does the honey. Definitely do not skip these. You can also add in fresh chopped herbs or dried herbs to the dough as you mix the other ingredients, such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, etc. for an extra boost of flavor.Baking Temperature and Time:This is just the dough recipe, but I’ve included instructions on how to form and bake with whatever toppings you like. See my pizza recipes here. Feel free to crank your oven higher than the 450°F listed in the recipe. My oven doesn’t reliably go much higher than that, nor do I enjoy cranking it any higher than that living here in Phoenix. Start checking your pizza around 12 minutes. I like my crust and cheese to be nice and golden brown, so I cook mine for about 15 minutes or even longer.",
        "Baking Stone￼This isn’t 100% necessary, if you have a pizza screen or other pan that creates a crisp crust, use that instead. However I LOVE my baking stone and find it creates the best pizza and this particular stone by Emile Henry is also safe to use on your grill, so you can make pizza in the summer without heating your whole kitchen up.",
        "Make Ahead:-In a warm spot in your house (at least 75°F), the dough should take no longer than 1 1/2 hours to rise. Instead, you can let the dough can ferment overnight in the fridge. Remove from the fridge and let come to room temperature, about 2 hours, before using.-Once you shape the dough into two smooth balls, they need to rest for about 30 minutes to relax the gluten. This will make it MUCH easier to shape into a thin circle. After 30 minutes, the dough can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Let rest at room temperature, covered in plastic so it won’t continue to rise, for 2 to 3 hours before shaping.-You can also freeze the dough, individually wrapped in plastic and placed in ziptop bags, for up to 1 month. Defrost in the fridge overnight then allow to sit at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours before shaping."

Mix in chocolate chips (if you want some chocolate chips showing through as those pictured, I like to set some of the chocolate chips aside then I gently press about 5 of them into the top of each cookie dough ball after shaping). Transfer dough to an airtight container and chill in refrigerator about 1 1/2 hours.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and scoop dough out about 2 1/2 Tbsp at a time and shape into balls, then align them on a large sheet of parchment or wax paper. Evenly flatten dough balls until you have about a 3 1/4-inch circle, then place 1 tsp chilled Nutella in the center on top of each. Carefully fold dough up and around Nutella, covering it entirely (if you find it beginning to seep through in some areas, I just added a chocolate chip to that spot to act as a plug). Transfer to a Silpat lined cookie sheet (you can fit 8 cookies per sheet) and bake in preheated oven 10 - 12 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle cookies with coarse sea salt (you can also sprinkle them with sea salt before baking as the salt sticks better that way, I actually did a tiny before and after). Allow to cool several minutes on cookie sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container.",

Working with one ball at a time, use your thumb to create a well in the center of the ball. Add a dollop of the Nutella to the well then seal the cookie dough around it so it’s completely enclosed. Repeat with all of the dough and Nutella, placing the balls of dough about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. (Note: the Nutella may soften as it sits at room temperature. If necessary, you can throw it back in the freezer to firm up.)",

        "2. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. In the bowl of your mixer, beat together the butter and sugar until well combined, about 3 minutes. Add in the vanilla, then one egg at a time, incorporating each egg before adding in the next one.",

Pat the streusel down a bit so it sticks to the brownie batter, then press your halved marshmallows into the batter (alternatively, you could swirl marshmallow creme or fluff into these brownies). Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until mostly set. The brownies will still jiggle a little when they’re done, but a toothpick should come out mostly clean. Allow to cool completely before slicing - these are ooey, gooey, fudgey brownies, so they’ll need to be set and cooled or else you’ll have a delicious mess on your hands when you go to cut them!"

Pretzel Bites - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or large mixing bowl and hand-knead), combine flour, water, yeast, oil, sugar, optional salt, and knead for about 5 minutes, or until dough is soft, smooth, and has come together in a firm mass. If hand-kneading, you may need to knead a few minutes longer. Based brand of yeast used, water temperature will vary. Red Star Platinum yeast calls for a warmer temperature than most, 120 to 130F; other brands are lower, about 95 to 105F. Warm water according to the yeast manufacturer's recommendations on the packaging. Taking the temperature with a digital thermometer is recommended, but if you're not, make sure the water is warm, not hot. Err on the cooler rather than hotter side so you don't kill the yeast.",

        "1. Make The Dough: Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water for about 1 minute. No need to use a thermometer for the water's temperature, but to be precise: about 105-115F degrees. Stir the yeast/water around. Then add orange zest, orange juice, sugar, salt, egg, butter, and 1.5 cups of flour. Beat everything together on low with a handheld mixer, scraping down the sides as needed. (A mixer is definitely needed to break up all the butter and beat everything to the proper consistency.) With a wooden spoon, stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a dough easy to handle - about 1.5 - 2 more cups. You are looking for a dough that is not sticky and will spring back when poked with a finger.",
        "2. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it with your hands for about 5-6 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the dough and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1.5 hours.",
        "3. Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with parchment paper,leaving room on the sides. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using a rolling in, roll into a 15x9 inch rectangle. I used a ruler for accuracy. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick, even at the corners.",
        "4. For The Filling: in a small bowl, mix together sugar and cinnamon. Spread the dough rectangle with softened butter and sprinkle generously with all of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Tightly roll up the dough and cut into 16 even rolls (1 inch in width each) with a very sharp knife. Arrange them in the prepared baking pan, cut sides up. Cover the rolls and let them rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes - 1 hour.",
        "5. Preheat the oven to 375F degrees. Cover the rolls with aluminum foil and bake for about 25-30 minutes, until they are lightly golden in color. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool for about 15 minutes.",
        "6. Make The Glaze: In a small bowl, mix together all of the glaze ingredients and drizzle over rolls before serving."

        "2. Once the yeast water is frothy, pour it into the bowl with the flour and salt. Stir the ingredients together until they form a shaggy ball of dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 minutes, incorporating an additional ½ to 1 cup of flour as you knead.",
        "3. After the dough has been kneaded for 8 minutes, it should be smooth, elastic, and will spring back when poked with a finger. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover lightly, and let rise for one hour or until double in size.",
        "4. Once the dough is double in size, punch the dough down, turn it out onto a clean surface, and flatten it into a disc. Cut the disc into 16 equal sized wedges. One by one, roll each wedge into a long rope, about ½ in diameter (about 18 inches long). Cut the rope into one inch sections, and place them on a baking sheet that has been covered with parchment and lightly misted with non-stick spray (you'll need two sheets to fit all the pretzel bites).",
        "5. Let the pretzel bites rise for 30 minutes, or until soft and pillowy. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, carefully addd ¼ cup of baking soda (it will fizz and bubble furiously for a moment, so be careful).",
        "6. Add 15-20 of the pretzel bites at a time to the boiling baking soda water and boil for about 90 seconds, or until puffed and a few begin to crack. Stir lightly as they boil to make sure all sides of the pretzel bites contact the boiling water. Remove the boiled pretzel bites with a slotted spoon and let drain on a wire cooling rack. Repeat in small batches until all of the pretzel bites are boiled.",
        "7. After the bites have drained for a few minutes, return them to the prepared baking sheets. Whisk together one egg with one tablespoon of water. Use a pastry brush to liberally brush the egg mixture over the boiled pretzel bites. If you want to make plain pretzel bites, sprinkle with coarse sea salt after brushing with the egg wash.",
        "8. Bake the pretzel bites for 15-17 minutes, or until deeply golden brown and shiny. Allow the pretzel bites to cool for a few minutes.",
        "9. In a small bowl, stir together the Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. In a separate small bowl, melt the butter in the microwave (microwave for 20 seconds, then stir until completely melted).",
        "10. Place the baked pretzel bites in a large bowl and pour the melted butter over top. Toss to coat. Add the parmesan topping and toss to coat again. Serve immediately."

        "3. Spray the pasta with a gentle stream of cold water to help cool it off. Drizzle the oil over the cooling pasta to keep it from sticking together. Gently toss the pasta, then put it in a covered container and let it cool in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or so.",
        "4. While the pasta is cooling down, prepare the vegetables: remove the seeds and soft pulp from the tomato(es) before dicing, using only the green part of the green onion (or scallions); and be sure to mince the cucumber into very small pieces.",
        "5. When the pasta is no longer warm, add the diced tomato, green onion, and cucumber. Sprinkle salt over the pasta salad to taste and put it back in the refrigerator until well chilled.",
        "6. When the pasta has chilled, spoon it onto plates and place the vinaigrette dressing on the side. For a cool garnish like that served in the restaurant, spread some leaves of green lettuce onto each plate, then spoon the pasta onto the lettuce. You may also toss the salad with the dressing ahead of time rather than serving it on the side. But don't do this too far in advance or the pasta tends to soak up the dressing."

Once all of the meat has been cooked and removed from the pan, add minced ginger and garlic. Saute ginger and garlic for approximately 60 seconds, the remaining oil should become very fragrant. Add soy sauce, water, Maggi seasoning, brown sugar, and rice wine vinegar. Stir until the sauce thickens, return meat to pan, and add quartered button mushrooms to the pan. Cook for another 60 seconds or so and add half of the chopped scallions. When serving the Mongolian beef add remaining scallions to the dish."

Add another tablespoon of the melted butter to the bowl and again whisk vigorously as you add it. Pour the egg mixture into the small saucepan and continue to whisk vigorously as you add it. Continue to whisk until the hollandaise JUST begins to thicken, about 3-4 minutes. As soon as it begins to thicken, add the gruyere cheese and season with chili powder, salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat immediately once the cheese has melted.Prepare the sandwiches by layering the swiss cheese, bacon, arugula, avocado, and eggs on the toasted ciabatta bread. At this point you may drizzle the hollandaise on the sandwich before you top it with the remaining slices of toast, or dip as you eat.Serve immediately and enjoy!"

Add the organic tomatoes, tomato juice, paste, seasonings and water, if needed. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting and let the tomato sauce simmer for 30-40 minutes until thick, fragrant, and the carrots are mostly tender. Remove from the heat and immediately transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth and use as instructed.

        "Cheese Steak Filling:1. Heat a nonstick pan with some canola or vegetable oil over medium flame until warmed; stir fry the onion, thinly sliced beef, mushroom and peppers until almost cooked through. Season with Worcestershire, garlic powder and salt and pepper and continue cooking until done. Set aside so that you give the beef time to soak up all the juices. *Slurp*",
        "Assembly:1. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F or 250 degrees C, at least 45-60 minutes before you put the stromboli in the oven.2. Sprinkle the counter top with a generous layer of cornmeal and stretch out your pizza dough into a 10 inch by 8 inch rectangle. Cover the surface with as much or as little tomato sauce as desired (I used around 1/3 cup worth) and spoon the cooled steak filling along one half of the rectangle (preferably the side closest to you). Sprinkle the top of the steak filling with a handful of cheese, and bring the other half of the dough over, sealing the filling inside the log. Press the edges together, making sure none of the filling can escape during the time it is  baking in the oven. Brush the entire stromboli with more olive oil and bake for 13-16 minutes or until golden brown and crunchy. Half-way through the baking, sprinkle the top of the pizza log with a few tablespoons of provolone cheese.3. Cool for 10 minutes to allow the juices to be absorbed, then slice and enjoy! Or channel a foodie caveman and shove the whole thing into your mouth. Not that I did that, in any way………ahem."

        "Baking Stone￼:-This isn’t 100% necessary, if you have a pizza screen or other pan that creates a crisp crust, use that instead. However I LOVE my baking stone and find it creates the best pizza and this particular stone by Emile Henry is also safe to use on your grill, so you can make pizza in the summer without heating your whole kitchen up.",

        "Parchment paper:-Use this to help you slide the uncooked pizza off the peel and onto the baking stone. Don’t worry, it may char but it won’t catch fire.",
        "Time:-The pizza dough can take literally all day to ferment and rise since it is a no-knead dough. The amount of time depends on how warm it is in your house (warmer = faster). However, this dough is also very forgiving so if you haven’t got all day it isn’t the end of the world. The dough will be more flavorful the longer it has fermented. I actually like to make the dough and let it rise day and night in the refrigerator. Bring it to room temperature, which can take a few hours, before using. See the make-ahead tips within the recipe.",
        "The Dough:-The dough recipe used in this video and recipe is Jim Lahey’s no-knead pizza dough. You basically just mix the ingredients together until they form a cohesive, shaggy, wet dough.-Once the dough has fermented, either at room temperature or overnight in the fridge, divide the dough into 3 equally sized balls.-At this point, the balls can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 1 month. See recipe for make-ahead instructions.-To make stretching and rolling out the dough easier, let the ball of dough rest at room temperature for about 1 hour before shaping.-If the dough springs back while you are trying to shape it, cover with a clean towel and let rest for 10 minutes before continuing shaping.-Beware of thin spots or tears in the dough where sauce and cheese may leak through and cause the pizza to stick to the stone or fall apart.-For more flavor, add fresh chopped herbs or dried herbs to the dough as you mix the other ingredients, such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, etc.-To make a whole wheat version, substitute half of the flour with whole wheat flour.",
        "The Toppings:-I stick with the classics in this video but feel free to add any toppings you desire, just don’t overload the pizza with watery toppings that will make for a soggy pie.-Raw meats like sausage, bacon, or chicken must be cooked before topping.-In the video I briefly saute the pepperoni, even though it does not need to be cooked, to render some of the fat so the pizza won’t be greasy and to ensure crisp pepperoni.-Use high quality freshly shredded mozzarella-I created a garlic butter crust in the video to boost the pizza’s flavor but if you don’t want to do this go ahead and brush the edges of the dough with olive oil before baking instead.",
        "Baking:-Place the baking stone on the bottom rack and preheat the oven to the highest temperature you can comfortably heat. For me, this is 500°F in the winter and 450°F in the summer. I also place mybaking stone on the grill to make pizza during the summer.-Make sure the pizza is well browned on the edges and the cheese is bubbling throughout before you remove from the oven, there’s nothing worse than undercooked pizza!"

Continue kneading for another 5 minutes (so now you’ve been kneading for 10 minutes total. Either by hand, or with a stand mixer.).3.Lightly oil a large bowl. Place ball of dough in bowl, and cover for 2 1/2 hours in a warm place. (I usually put it near/on top of my stove.)4.After 2 1/2 hours, your dough should be nice and risen and puffy. Flour your work surface and roll out dough into a rectangle.5.Spread on softened SALTED butter, sprinkle garlic powder on top of that, then the sauce, then finally the pepperoni.6.Gently roll up into a log and pinch the ends closed. Refrigerate log for at least 20 minutes (refrigerating makes cutting the rolls wicked easy. The dough at this point is soft, but you can cut it if you cant wait any longer. They might not look pretty though.).7.Cut rolls, place in greased pan, and put inside cold oven.8.Put a pan of hot boiling water on the rack underneath the pan of rolls, and close the oven door. Leave the oven door closed for 30 mins.9.After 30 minutes, take out pan of water, and pan of rolls, and preheat oven to 350°. Bake rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until tops are brown and cooked throughout."

Place the canning lids on the bottom and arrange the eggs in and around the lids. Heat up the pressure cooker until it reaches low pressure and then cook for 6 minutes. Allow the pressure to go down naturally and then immediately remove the eggs and cool them in ice water to stop the cooking process. When they are cool, the eggs will crack with ease, look beautiful, and taste perfect every time!￼Heather has a great video showing the steps and how easy it is to cook eggs perfectly in the pressure cooker. You need to go watch it, you’ll be amazed how easily they peel.I pressure cooked 6 eggs in my pressure cooker on low pressure. It took 6 minutes to pressure up, 6 minutes cook time, and 6 minutes for a natural pressure release for perfectly cooked eggs.￼Update: After some feedback from readers, I decided to try separating my eggs with silicone baking cups￼. The result was terrific, no broken eggs even on a second layer and no discoloration on the whites. Visit my Easter egg post for more info on using silcone cups ."

        "7 Note: Shoulder or butt are recommended because the meat shreds very well. Other cuts do not shred as readily. It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid.",
        "8 Note 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!",
        "9 Note3: You might want to turn your roast over after it's cooked a while, to ensure more even cooking. I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker. Remember that each time you remove the lid you lose heat and be careful, as turning a large piece of meat is awkward."

You can make them larger than listed in the recipe (which is what I did after the first batch because the 1 1/2-inch rounds yields pretty small cookies). If you do decide to pipe them bigger just allow a little more space between each cookie.",
        "Measure 4 cups of powdered sugar into a mixing bowl, set aside. Brown butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling pan occasionally (butter will melt, after a few minutes it will splatter, then it will foam, then golden brown flecks will begin to appear in the center of the foamy bubbles. This is when you remove it from heat - I wait for for the flecks to expand to about a 1 1/2 to 2-inch circle over the foam then immediately remove). Carefully pour browned butter over powdered sugar in mixing bowl, use a rubber spatula to scrape any excess butter and browned bits from pan. Add half and half and stir mixture until smooth. Spread over cookies, adding additional half and half, about 1 - 2 tsp at a time, to icing mixture to thin as it will thicken as it sits."

The recipe and directions for the best and flakiest pie pastry are found here.  Roll out your pastry on a floured surface, then drape on your rolling pin and transfer to the pie/tart plate.  This is a one crust pie so we want the edges nice and clean that come up to the top of your pie plate.  The next step is blind baking which is necessary for all tarts that are filled later or to ensure that the crust is not too soggy. Line your unbaked pie crust with parchment paper and fill the pie plate with rice or beans (or a combination like I did because I didn’t have enough of each to fill the plate!). Bake at 400F/200C for 15 minutes, then take out of the oven, turn the temperature to 350F/180C, let it cool for 5 minutes and then lift the parchment paper together with the weights out of the pie.",
        "While your crust is blind baking make your pumpkin filling. Beat your eggs with sugar, then add pumpkin puree, cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and salt. Set aside for a moment.  Now chop up your toblerone bar and melt it in a double boiler, stirring continuously so it doesn’t burn. ",
        "Pour the pumpkin filling in the pie crust, then drop in melted chocolate randomly.￼Then take a skewer or a tooth pick and swirl it lightly.￼Bake in the oven for 40 minutes until the filling is set. It will probably crack like mine did because of the different consistency of pumpkin filling and chocolate but I thought it made it look even cooler!￼Toblerone made some pretty amazing craters in that pumpkin. Don’t you think?Whip some cream with powdered sugar and vanilla.Do serve it with some whipped cream and crushed honeycomb or nougat, the extra crunch is heavenly!"

The moisture content in pumpkin varies, as do climates and ovens; bake until yours are done. Allow bars to cool in pan for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. I find the bars taste better on the second and third day after the flavors have married. Bars continue to get softer and moister for about 3 days after baking, noting the cinnamon-sugar coating will melt (liquify) as time passes rather than stay granular due to the moisture from the bars. Bars will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.",

Add the garlic and sauté for two minutes more.

Once tortillas are warmed and you are ready to assemble your burritos, place approximately one cup of the filling mixture in the center of a tortilla. Fold the bottom of the tortilla (the edge closest to you) up and over the filling, then fold each side in and over the bottom. Tightly tuck and roll the burrito away from you to finish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling mixture. Note that because you are going to top these burritos generously with hot queso, I recommend lining them up in an even layer inside a 9″ x 13″ baking dish.",

If you are choosing instead to serve it with chips, I would recommend increasing the amount of heavy cream that you incorporate from one half cup to one whole cup. Additional cream will simply prevent the unpleasantness that is broken tortilla chips stuck in your dip."

Let milk mixture cool to 110 - 115 degrees and add to proofed yeast mixture. Stir in egg, vanilla, salt and 3/4 cup sugar. Slowly add flour, and knead mixture with kneading attachment, until smooth and elastic (the mixture will seem runny like it needs more flour, but don't add more than the 5 cups called for). Cover mixture and let rise until double, about 1 hour. Now sprinkle 1 tsp baking powder over dough and slowly knead with kneading attachment once more about 1 minute. Divide the dough into two equal portions (I found it was much easier to work with this way). On a generously floured surface roll each piece of dough into a 12\"x16\" rectangle. Now brush each piece with about 1 Tbsp of the melted butter. In a small bowl combine the 1/3 cup sugar and raspberry jam. Brush raspberry jam mixture over each piece of dough coming within 1\" of the edge on all sides. With floured hands, starting on the 16\" side, carefully begin tightly rolling up dough. Once each piece of dough is rolled, cut each dough log into 12, 1 1/4\" slices. Place rolls onto 2 greased jellyroll pans. Let rise until doubled about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

You can omit it--just be prepared to stay with the sauce a little longer to thicken it. Boil crab legs as you normally would in boiling water. Crack open legs, dab meat lightly with paper towel to remove excess water, and place the meats on top of the alfredo sauce and pasta."

Bring to a boil and then lower heat to simmer, covered, for about 2 1/2 hours. The cooking time will vary depending on the batch of beans you have. The beans are done when they are soft and the skin is just beginning to break open.Pressure Cooker method Put beans into a 4 quart pressure cooker with a 15 lb weight. Fill up the pressure cooker with water, up to the line that indicates the capacity for the pot. Cook for 30-35 minutes - until the beans are soft and the skins are barely breaking open. Allow the pressure cooker to cool completely before opening. If there is resistance when attempting to open the cooker, do not open it, allow it to cool further. Follow the directions for your brand of pressure cooker. (See safety tips on using pressure cookers.)",

        "3 Add the onions and lard/fat/oil to a wide, sturdy (not with a flimsy stick-free lining) frying pan on medium high heat. Cook onions until translucent. (Note the onions are optional, you can skip them if you want.) Add the strained beans and about a 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Using a potato masher, mash the beans in the pan, while you are cooking them, until they are a rough purée. Add more water if necessary to keep the fried beans from getting too dried out. Add salt to taste. Add a few slices of cheddar cheese, or some (1/2 cup) grated cheddar cheese if you want. When beans are heated through (and optional cheese melted) the beans are ready to serve.",
        "Note that many recipes call for soaking the beans overnight and discarding the soaking liquid. We don't. We discard the cooking liquid and just add some water back into the frying pan when we are frying the beans."

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and brush the pork with the remaining glaze. Let the pork rest for 10 minutes.",

Then pile on the ham and then the turkey, two or three slices of each should be good. We are going to put this in the oven and want everything to be warm throughout so not too much. Second Way: Pile on the ham then the turkey then the pepperoni, this way the pepperoni gets a little crispy on the edges. Either of these ways are good.",

        "½ cup brown sugar",
        "2 graham cracker sheets"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "For the Dough:1. Combine the warm water and yeast in the bowl of your mixer and let stand for 5-7 minutes or so, until the yeast foams up a bit. Add in the flour, graham cracker crumbs, sugar, cinnamon and oil. Using the hook attachment on your mixer, mix, then knead, for 5 minutes, until the dough comes together, is smooth, and starts to slap the side of the bowl. It should be slightly tacky but not too sticky to handle - add a bit more flour if you need it.",
        "2. Grease a bowl, form the dough into a ball, and place the dough in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and/or a towel, put in a warm place (but not too warm) and let the dough rise for 30-45 minutes. While the dough rises, make your marshmallow and chocolate filling.",
        "For the Marshmallow:1. Stir together the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often, until the it reaches 240 degrees F on a candy/fat thermometer. Be careful not to let the mixture bubble over - turn the heat down if you need and keep a watchful eye over it. This might take a little longer than you think, but just keep at it. Mine took about 10 minutes, but when you're standing there watching it, it feels like an eternity. It got stuck at around 220 for what seemed like forever, but then it eventually got up to 240.",
        "2. Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Start whipping the egg whites to soft peaks on medium speed. You want to have the egg whites whipped and ready to go, waiting for your syrup to be drizzled in. If they’re whipping faster than your syrup is coming to temperature, just stop the mixer until the syrup is ready, which is what I did.",
        "3. When the syrup reaches 240 degrees F, reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly drizzle about 2 tablespoons of syrup into the egg whites to warm them. If you add too much syrup at once, the whites will scramble. Slowly drizzle in the rest of the syrup, a bit at a time - seriously, do not do more than 2 tablespoons at a time.",
        "4. Increase the speed to medium high and whip until the marshmallow fluff is stiff and glossy, about 7 solid minutes. Don't try to speed this process up! Add in the vanilla and whip 2 minutes more. Use the fluff that day or refrigerate stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. You'll have a little extra, so I highly recommend spreading the remaining fluff on top of your warm cinnamon rolls!",
        "For the Chocolate:1. If you have a double boiler, great, use that, but I don't, so I just melt chocolate very slowly and carefully because it burns easily. In a saucepan, combine your cocoa powder, heavy cream, chocolate, sugar, butter and salt. Stir over medium-low heat constantly until everything is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. The mixture will thicken up as it cools down, making it easy to spread.",
        "For Assembly:1. Roll out your dough on a well floured surface out to about 15 inches by 20 inches, give or take. It definitely doesn't have to be perfect! Spread 2 tablespoons of melted butter over the rolled out dough. Spread half of your fluff over the dough, then all of your chocolate (again, doesn't have to be perfect), being sure to leave a 1-inch strip around all sides to make rolling easier. Sprinkle your brown sugar on top, then use your hands to roughly crush the 2 sheets of graham cracker over everything.",
        "2. Starting on the long edge closest to you, roll up your dough carefully, as tightly as you can. Use your fingers to tap down the final edge to seal the rolls as best as you can. Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish (or a 12-inch round dish, like I did), then slice the rolls into 1½-inch rounds and place them in the dish an inch or two apart. Cover with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise one more time for 30 minutes.",
        "3. When you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Place the rolls in the oven and bake for 40-50 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm with a side of marshmallow, or let cool, cover, and keep at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

      "directions": [
        "For the Crust:1. Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl or the bowl of your food processor. I used my food processor, but I didn’t always have one and have had great results making this crust by hand. Please note that this is basically a double pie, meaning it is a lot of dough! I did mine in two batches (i.e. divided the recipe in half, which is my go-to regular pie crust, and did it two times - if you have a giant mixing bowl or food processor, go for it, but my equipment isn't large enough to handle 7½ cups of flour).",
        "2. Add in the chopped pieces of cold butter and cold shortening . Blend together with your hands or pulse with your processor until you have coarse crumbs (it doesn’t have to be perfect). You can use a pastry cutter, too, but I find that a clean pair of hands work best. Mix together the water and vinegar in a small bowl. When ready, slowly drizzle it over the dough, a tablespoon or so at a time, gently stirring the mixture with a fork or pulsing with your processor, until fully incorporated (you may not use all of the water).",
        "3. It might seem a bit too wet at this point, but it will dry up while it sits in the fridge. Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours or as long as overnight (as always, overnight is best). Make your filling when you are almost ready to use your dough.",
        "For the Marshmallow:1. Stir together the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often, until the it reaches 240 degrees F on a candy/fat thermometer. Be careful not to let the mixture bubble over - turn the heat down if you need and keep a watchful eye over it. This might take a little longer than you think, but just keep at it. Mine took about 10 minutes, but when you're standing there watching it, it feels like an eternity. It got stuck at around 220 for what seemed like forever, but then it eventually got up to 240.",
        "2. Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Start whipping the egg whites to soft peaks on medium speed. You want to have the egg whites whipped and ready to go, waiting for your syrup to be drizzled in. If they’re whipping faster than your syrup is coming to temperature, just stop the mixer until the syrup is ready, which is what I did.",
        "3. When the syrup reaches 240 degrees F, reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly drizzle about 2 tablespoons of syrup into the egg whites to warm them. If you add too much syrup at once, the whites will scramble. Slowly drizzle in the rest of the syrup, a bit at a time - seriously, do not do more than 2 tablespoons at a time.",
        "4. Increase the speed to medium high and whip until the marshmallow fluff is stiff and glossy, about 7 solid minutes. Don't try to speed this process up! Add in the vanilla and whip 2 minutes more. Use the fluff immediately or refrigerate stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. I made my fluff about 4 hours ahead of time before baking with it, and I actually doubled the recipe so that I'd have some extra to spread of the top of the pie pieces...just an idea!",
        "For the Chocolate:1. If you have a double boiler, great, use that, but I don't, so I just melt chocolate very slowly and carefully because it burns easily. In a saucepan, combine your cocoa powder, heavy cream, chocolate, sugar, butter and salt. Stir over medium-low heat constantly until everything is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. The mixture will thicken up as it cools down, making it easy to spread over your pie crust later.",
        "For Assembly:1. Remove your crust from the refrigerator to allow for easier rolling. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Generously butter a 9x13-inch baking sheet.",
        "2. Roll out your first ball of dough - it should be about 10x14 or 11x15, if you can get it to stretch that far - it does not have to be perfect by any means. If you need to re-roll a few scraps here and there to patch up pieces, that's fine - I did it! It will all bake together in the end. Roll out your rectangle, then fold it over onto itself to more easily move it over onto the baking sheet. Unfold it and gently press the pie crust into the bottom of the 9x13-inch baking sheet.",
        "3. Spread your chocolate mixture over the dough, then spread the marshmallow mixture over the top of that. You may have a bit extra - this is your baker's reward! Sprinkle 4 crushed graham crackers over the top of the marshmallow. Roll out your second pie crust and gently place it over the top. Crimp the edges together, discarding any scraps (or using them to decorate the pie, dealer's choice).",
        "4. Use a fork to make a pattern in the top of the pie (see photos), like a traditional s'mores Pop-Tart. Beat together your egg and water and brush the top of the pie with it. Place the pie in the oven, the reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until golden brown and shiny on top. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.",
        "5. If you like, you can add a chocolate glaze on top. Whisk together your powdered sugar, cocoa powder and heavy cream. It should be a thin consistency. Spread the glaze over the top of the pie. Allow the pie to cool completely (you can put it in the fridge, if you want - I recommend this if it's a hot summer day), then slice, serve and enjoy!"

Add the cubed butter and shortening and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. 3.Combine vinegar and water and add to the dough in a slow drizzle while pulsing. Stop when the dough forms clumps. You may not need to add all the water or you may need to add a touch more if dough is crumbly.4.Pat the dough into two disks, cover with cling film and chill for an hour (or up to a day).5.Prepare your filling: peel and core the apples then either slice thinly with a sharp knife of use the widest setting on a mandoline. Keep slices small and equally sized. Toss with the lemon juice and set aside while pastry is chilling.6.Dust your worktop and rolling pin with flour. Roll one of the dough disks out to 6mm (1/4 inch thick). Transfer onto the pie tin, leaving the pastry to hang over the edges, cover and chill for 30 minutes. 7.Roll out the second piece of dough onto a large piece of baking paper. Cut into wide, equally sized strips using a pizza wheel then transfer onto a baking tray and chill for 30 minutes.8.Strain the apples to get rid of any juices and then toss with the spices, flour, cornflour and sugar.9.Pile the apples, packed quite tightly, into the prepared pie tin (mine was 20cm/8in but there was enough pastry for a slightly larger pie). Create a little mound in the centre and drizzle with the salted caramel (if using).10.Take out the pastry strips and lay the longest ones in the centre of the pie vertically. Start placing strips horizontally, weaving them with the one vertical ones to create a lattice (see here for a very helpful diagram from the Smitten Kitchen). 11.Fold the overhanging pastry over the lattice and create a fluted edge by pushing your thumb from one hand in between the thumb and index finger of the opposite. 12.Return to the fridge for 30 minutes then brush all over with the egg wash and sprinkle with demerara sugar.13.Preheat the oven to 200C (400F) and place a heavy baking tray on the lowest shelf (do not skip this step: the filling has a tendency to bubble over).14.Put the pie in the oven for 15-20 minutes until it has started to brown nicely, then reduce the temperature to 180C (350F). At this stage you may need to cover with a foil hat to prevent further browning.15.Bake for another 30-35 minutes of until the apples are soft enough to prick with a skewer. The pie is usually ready when the filling starts to bubble over and takes on average about an hour to bake.16.Cool for several hours before serving - it can take up to 6 hours or longer for the pie to cool completely. If you serve while still hot it won't be easy to slice (but is it ever delicious!)."

        "3. When the 20 minutes are up, generously flour a work surface, and place the dough onto it. Using a well-floured rolling pin, begin to press down onto the dough. You are aiming to flatten out those cubes of butter. Keep going until the dough is about ½ inch (1cm) thick, and then begin to roll the dough out into a rectangle about 15x8inches (40x20cm).",

When the dough has been folded the final time, wrap it in plastic again, and place it in the fridge. After about 20 minutes chilling, it will be ready to go. You can leave it in the fridge, well wrapped for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",
        "6. To make the filling, finely slice the onions, and place them in a large frying pan with the oil, butter and rosemary. Cook the onions over a medium-low flame, stirring occasionally for at least 25 minutes, or until they are deeply golden, and dark brown in patches. Set aside to cool.",
        "7. Remove the sausage meat from the casings, and place in a large mixing bowl, with the breadcrumbs and cooled onion. Mix together well.",
        "8. When you're ready to bake the sausage rolls, preheat the oven to 425F (220C).",
        "9. Roll out the pastry on a well floured surface, to a square about 13x13inches (33x33cm).",
        "10. Divide the pastry into two rectangles, and then take half of the filling, and form it into a long sausage shape down the centre of each rectangle.",
        "11. Roll the pastry around the filling to enclose it, and then slice each log into three sausage rolls. Transfer the sausage rolls to a lined baking sheet, brush with beaten egg (if desired), and cut decorations into the top of the pastry (if you want to). Bake the sausage rolls for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Enjoy!"

        "2. A couple of tips: Having a slotted spoon makes transferring the shrimp and shaking off the excess breading easier, otherwise try keeping one hand for working with the wet ingredients and one for the dry to avoid breading your fingers.",
        "3. Transfer a large handful or scoop of shrimp to the plain flour. Toss to coat and shake to remove excess flour before putting the shrimp into the egg wash. Then transfer the shrimp from the egg wash to the “fish fry mix.” Toss to coat and again shake gently to remove excess before placing on the clean end plate. Repeat until all the shrimp are breaded.",
        "4. Heat the canola oil in a large fry pan on medium heat for 5-7 minutes or until hot but not smoking. Test the oil by sprinkling a few drops of water into the pan, if it sizzles, it’s ready. Carefully place a serving spoonful of shrimp into the oil using and use the spoon to gently break them up. You can add a second scoop, depending on the size of your pan but be careful not to overcrowd the pan because you don’t want to lower the oil’s temperature or you’ll end up with greasy rather than crispy shrimp.",
        "5. If the oil doesn’t cover the shrimp you will want to gently nudge them over so they cook on both sides. If you’re working with pre-cooked shrimp, you only need to fry them long enough to crisp the breading and heat the shrimp, about 2 minutes per batch. If you’re working with larger or raw shrimp, you may need to adjust the cooking time. When the breading is golden and crisp but before they get brown use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. As your batches are frying, prepare your remaining ingredients so you can assemble your po’ boys!",
        "6. You can toast the baguette for a few minutes at 350° to crisp the crust and warm the inside. Then cut the bread in half lengthwise, spread with a Tablespoon of mayo. Place several pickle slices on the bottom half of the bread. Top with the fried shrimp and then a handful of shredded lettuce and tomato slices.",
        "7. For a true New Orleans experience add a bit of Tabasco or Crystal-brand hot sauce to finish it off."

If you don’t have a food processor, you can mince the shrimp with a knife and mix everything else together in a bowl by hand.￼Cut the crusts off the bread (the crust will burn if you leave it on), then cut the bread into four triangles, squares or sticks. Spread about a teaspoon of the shrimp mixture on each piece of bread. Make sure to get the shrimp all the way to the edges or the bread will curl while frying. Press a small piece of parsley into each toast for color.",

        "1 These directions are long because I am covering the method quite thoroughly for new-comers. (-;.",
        "2 SOAK BEANS: On Sunday night (or the night before you want to eat these yummy beans), check beans to be sure there are no stones then place beans in a large bowl and fill almost to the top with water. It's better to have too much water than not enough. The beans will more than double in size overnight. In the morning, I drain beans in a colander and rinse well.",
        "3 A FEW PERSONAL TRICKS: One of the first things I do in the morning is fill my Crockpot with hot tap water just to bring it up to temperature much faster. This saves on cooking time and electricity. I also fill and boil my electric jug (or kettle) - this is the water I will use to cook my beans.",
        "4 PLACE IN CROCKPOT: Beans, ham hock, black pepper, chicken stock powder, chopped garlic, garlic salt, bay leaves, and optional Chipotle powder and liquid smoke. Note: Save adding salt until the end of cook time.",
        "5 COVER WITH HOT WATER: Cover beans with hot water from your jug or kettle just until fully covered. Then add an extra inch of water on top of that. This will give your beans a chance to swell even more during cooking. Cover Crockpot with lid.",
        "6 QUICKLY: Sauté onions and bell-pepper just until they begin to cook. Add these to the beans and stir.",
        "7 COOK: If you are going to be gone all day, cook beans on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. If you will be around to stir, etc., I recommend cooking them on high until they are almost fully cooked (about 4 or 5 hours). Then turn them down to low for the last bit of cooking.",
        "8 ONCE COOKED: When beans are fully cooked, remove bay leaves (if you can find them all) add butter and stir. To thicken beans, add 2 tablespoons corn flour mixed with just enough cold water to dissolve it. Add this to beans and stir for a minute. Beans should thicken a bit in fairly short order. Repeat until you get the desired consistency.",
        "9 ADD: Add salt by half-teaspoon until you reach the level of your liking. It may not take much for you. Also add a bit more fresh ground pepper.",
        "10 NOW: Put your rice on to cook. Slice smoked sausage and cook in a medium-hot cast iron skillet until nicely brown and starting to emit those nice juices. Take skillet off heat but leave sausages where they are. Don't cover.",
        "11 RINSE your rice with hot water. Once drained, place about half a cup of hot fluffy rice in a wide, shallow bowl.",
        "12 COVER rice with a generous amount of red beans. Top with a good amount of hot smoked sausage slices.",
        "13 SPRINKLE with hot sauce and/or more Tony's if you want it spicy like I do.",
        "14 SERVE with hot buttered, grilled slices of French bread, salad or coleslaw, and a big glass of iced tea.",

Transfer to Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheets, spacing cookies 2-inches apart. Flatten cookies slightly and bake in preheated oven 7 - 8 minutes (under-bake them just a tad as you'll be returning them to the oven for about another minute).",
        "While cookies are baking, using scissors, cut marshmallows into halves and unwrap Hershey's Kisses. Remove cookies from oven. Allow to cool 5 minutes (waiting 5 minutes is optional, it just seemed to help the marshmallow hold their shape a little better. Not a huge difference though). Top each cookie with a marshmallow (cut side facing downward). Heat oven broiler, place oven rack several levels below broiler element and transfer marshmallow topped cookies to oven (don't take your eyes off of them, they'll brown rather quickly), allow to broil about 1 minute (maybe less, maybe more). Remove from oven and gently press 1 kiss into the center of each toasted marshmallow. Serve warm or allow to cool and store in an airtight container."

They won't expand while baking, so they can be piped close together. The goal is to have meringue cookies that will be roughly the same size as your butter cookies, so base the diameter of your rosettes on the cookie cutter you plan to use for your cookies. Bake at 200F for 1 hour, then reduce temperature to 175F, and continue baking another hour. You don't want the cookies to brown, so keep an eye on them during the last 30 minutes of baking. ",

If not, return them to the oven and bake until they reach that texture.",
        "4) Make the Butter Cookies: Preheat oven to 350F. In a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla. Add the salt, baking powder, and 1 cup of the flour and mix until incorporated. Continue adding the flour, adding the milk as necessary to keep the dough from getting too stiff. ",
        "5) Divide the dough in half and shape into 2 disks. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. ",
        "6) On a lightly floured surface, roll chilled dough, 1 disk at a time, to 1/4 inch thick. Cut with desired cookie cutter and place on a parchment-lined (or Silpat-lined) baking sheet. Chill in the freezer for 7-8 minutes before baking. Bake at 350F for about 10 minutes, until edges and bottom of cookies are lightly golden. Let cool on wire racks. ",
        "7) Make the Chocolate Buttercream: In a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and melted chocolate. Add the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, adding milk as needed to keep the frosting at a pipe-able consistency. Place the frosting in a pastry bag fit with an Ateco 846 tip. ",
        "8) Assembly: Melt the 1/3 cup chocolate chips and place in a ziploc sandwich bag. Cut out a small corner from the bag, creating a quick/easy/cheap pastry bag to drizzle the chocolate from. Take one butter cookie and pipe a rosette with chocolate buttercream that is about 1/8 inch smaller in diameter than the cookie. Place a meringue cookie on top and lightly press down to adhere. Drizzle with melted chocolate. Repeat with the rest of the cookies and frosting. ",

        "13. This next part is tricky—my oven is kind of wonky, so I can only keep the cookies in for another 2-3 minutes before they are finished. The original recipe calls for 7 minutes for each side. I would advise you set a timer for 3 minutes and check to see how the cookies are doing. If the center looks solid and you see VERY slight browning at the edges, you’re done! Don’t let it get golden-brown or the cookies will over-bake and the entire cookie will be crunchy.",
        "14. Take the baking sheet out of the oven and allow the cookies to cool for a minute before transferring to a cooling rack.",
        "15. After a few minutes, they’re ready to eat! Definitely best when right out of the oven, but if you keep them in an airtight container, they will maintain their chewiness. I’ve never been able to hold onto these for more than a night, so I couldn’t vouch for how long they keep. Enjoy!"

        "1. To the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or using an electric mixer, combine peanut butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until well-combined and the sugar is fully incorporated and is mixture is no longer gritty or granular, about 5 minutes, or as long as necessary (7 to 8 minutes). If beating with a hand mixer rather than a stand mixer, 7 minutes+ may be necessary. Don't shortcut this step. Stop to scrape down the bowl as necessary. Batter may seem oily; this is okay. Note regarding peanut butter - although natural peanut butter or homemade peanut butter may work, I recommend using storebought peanut butter like Jif, Skippy, Peter Pan or similar so that cookies bake up thicker and spread less. Using natural or homemade peanut butter tends to result in thinner and flatter cookies that are prone to spreading while baking.",

        "3. Add the Heath bits and beat to just incorporate; don't overmix.",

Place mounds on a large plate, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Chilling is mandatory, do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter.",
        "5. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for 8 to 9 minutes, or until edges are set and tops are barely set, even if slightly underbaked in the center. Cookies firm up as they cool, and baking too long results in cookies that become too crisp and hard. The cookies in the photos were baked for 8 minutes, and have chewy edges with soft centers.",
        "6. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired."

        "⅔ cup COLD unsalted butter, cubed",

      "directions": [
        "1. Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl or in a food processor. Add in the cubed, cold and cold shortening. Blend together with your hands, a pastry cutter, or food processor until you have coarse crumbs (it doesn’t have to be perfect). I used to just use my hands to do this before I got a food processor, so don’t be afraid to get in there!",
        "2. Mix together the water and vinegar in a small bowl. When ready, slowly drizzle it over the dough, a tablespoon or so at a time, gently stirring the mixture with a fork (or pulsing with your processor), until fully incorporated. It might seem a bit too wet at this point, but it will dry up while it sits in the fridge. Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours, or as long as overnight. After at least 3 hours, take one ball of dough and roll out it onto a lightly floured surface, until it is about 2-inches in diameter bigger than your pie dish. Place the rolled out dough into your pie dish and smooth it out so that it lays evenly. Crimp the edges however you like, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for at least an hour prior to baking your pie – this step really helps the pie to firm up later, as well as dry out a little bit more, as the filling is a bit wet and you don’t want your pie crust to be soggy!",
        "3. First, you need to rehydrate your chiles. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment. Cut the stems off of your chiles, and shake out as many seeds as possible. Bake for 5-8 minutes, until the chiles are just beginning to blacken. Pick them up and shake out any remaining seeds (you don’t have to get them all, so don’t worry), then place them in a large bowl and cover with hot water (I just used the hottest water from my tap) and cover with a paper towel. Let the chiles sit for 30 minutes or so, stirring halfway through to be sure that they are all immersed in the water as much as possible.",
        "4. When the chiles are ready, remove them with tongs and place them in a food processor or a blender, along with about 1½ cups of water that the chiles were soaking in, the peeled garlic, the oregano, cumin, salt, and red pepper flake, Pulse until you have a very smooth puree and set aside.",
        "5. Remove any large bits of fat, skin, or bone from your pork (a little fat is fine, it’s even encouraged, but you don’t want big hunks of it messing up your delicious pork) and cut into pieces about the size of your hand. Place the pork in a sealable bag and pour in the chile marinade. Seal and shake to make sure that your pork is completely coated. Place in the refrigerator for a minimum of 8 hours, but 24 hours is preferred (I let mine sit for a full 24 hours).",
        "6. When the pork is ready, preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Place your pork and the rest of the marinade in a baking dish (I used a greased glass 9×13 baking dish) and cover tightly with foil (or a lid, if you’re lucky enough to have an oven-safe one). Roast for 3 hours or so, until tender. You shouldn’t even need to shred this pork with two forks, you should just be able to pull it apart effortlessly with one fork (this is the test). When ready, move the pork to a cutting board and leave the juices in the pan. Shred the pork, and then chop it a bit, if you like. Reserve the juices for when you are assembling your pie. Set aside until you are ready to use.",
        "7. Before your bake your pie, roll out 1 ball of dough on a lightly floured surface until it is about 2-inches in diameter larger than your pie dish. Gently place the rolled out dough into your pie dish, and crimp or cut off any extra dough that hangs off of the side. Keep these scraps, roll them into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and save to use as you finish your pie (I used mine as decoration). Wrap your pie dish with the pie crust inside tightly with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 1 hour.",
        "8. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine your carne adobada, rice, beans, and about ¼ to ½ cup of juices from the pork and toss to combine. Place all of this into your pie crust, then roll out your remaining ball of dough on a lightly floured surface and place it over the top of your pie. Crimp the edges together with the bottom crust, and then cut an “X” in the middle of the pie so that the steam can escape from inside as it baked. Brush the crust lightly with your beaten egg. Using tinfoil, create a barrier around the edge of your pie, so that the crust does not cook too quickly, and place in the middle rack of the oven for 30 minutes.",
        "9. After 30 minutes, remove the foil barrier and place the pie back in the oven for another 25-30 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven, let rest for 10 minutes or so, then slice and serve alongside crème fraiche, sour cream, cilantro, and/or lime wedges."

Place Melba crumbs into a large, shallow dish and add the cornmeal, parmesan, paprika, chili powder, black pepper, garlic and onion powder, and salt. Mix together thoroughly.2.)  Crack eggs into another shallow dish and add hot sauce. Mix thoroughly with whisk or fork, and set aside. Add flour and salt into the last shallow dish, then also mix thoroughly.3.)  Use paper towels to blot off excess moisture from the raw chicken tenders. Dip each tender completely into the flour dredge first, then the egg dredge, and then finally into the cornmeal coating.4.)  Place fully dredged and coated tenders on a large baking sheet covered with foil and sprayed with non-stick oil spray. After you finish coating all the tenders, give each tender a heavy spray of oil spray or drizzle with olive oil before placing in the oven. Bake the tenders for 15-17 minutes, until golden brown. After taking them out of the oven, I like to place the tenders on a cooling rack to prevent them from becoming soggy and to stop the cooking process (like you would with cookies). Scatter the tenders with dried parsley as a garnish.5.)  Place all the tea dipping sauce ingredients (except water and cornstarch) in a small pot. In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup cold water and cornstarch into a slurry. Place pot on high heat, and then let the liquid come to a boil. When the liquid reaches a full boil, mix in the slurry, and then lower the heat to medium and let the mixture come back to a boil. Take the sauce off the heat and serve it with the hot chicken tenders. The sauce will thicken as it cools."

        "Prepare your flour coating by adding the flour, the black pepper, granulated garlic and onion, paprika, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and 1 ½ teaspoons of salt into a large bowl, and mix to combine; drizzle in the 1 tablespoon of buttermilk, and using your fingers, mix the buttermilk into the flour creating little “chunky” flour bits (this is good for a little extra crispiness when it fries).",
        "To coat your chicken, take 1 breast cutlet out of the buttermilk, and allow the excess to drip off; next, add the chicken to the seasoned flour, pressing it in and turning to coat both sides, then place the coated chicken on a clean plate; repeat the process until all chicken cutlets are flour coated. (I like mine a little “extra crispy”, so I re-dredge each breast, one at a time, back in the buttermilk, then once again into the seasoned flour, and back to the plate, and repeat until all cutlets are double-dredged.)",
        "Add about 4-6 cups of oil to a Dutch oven or heavy bottom deeper pan, so that the oil comes roughly halfway up the sides; place a clip-on digital thermometer onto the side, and bring the oil up to 350°.",
        "Once the oil is hot, work in batches by adding 2 of the breasts into the oil, allowing them to fry for a total of about 6 minutes, about 3 minutes per side (you can turn them frequently as I did, if you see that they’re browning too much on one side), or until golden-brown and cooked through (you can also turn down the temp of the oil slightly if the breasts are browning too quickly); remove from pan and allow the chicken to drain on a paper towel-lined plate; repeat with the remaining chicken, and then allow the chicken to “rest” for just a few minutes out of the oil.",
        "Top each crispy fried chicken breast with 1 tablespoon’s worth of the grated or shredded parmesan cheese, then lay a slice of the mozzarella cheese over that; place the cheese-topped chicken breasts onto a foil-lined baking sheet, and place them into the oven on a “low” broil to very quickly melt the cheese, just for a moment.",
        "Assemble your sandwiches by slathering on a good amount of the Creamy Garlic-Parmesan Sauce onto both the top and bottom buns, then lay a leaf or two of romaine on the bottom bun, followed by a chicken filet, tomato slices, then 2 bacon halves, then the top bun; serve hot with Sea Salt Oven Fries, if desired.",
        "Creamy Garlic-Parmesan Sauce:Place all ingredients into the bowl of a food processor, and process until completely smooth and creamy; store in a covered container, and keep any extra in fridge.",
        "Sea Salt Oven Fries:Preheat the oven to 400°; line a baking sheet with foil that has been misted with cooking spray.",
        "Toss the matchstick russet potatoes with about 2 tablespoons of oil, a couple of good pinches of sea salt and black pepper, plus the paprika, and toss the ingredients together; turn the seasoned potatoes out onto the prepared baking sheet in as much of a single layer as possible, and bake the fries for about 45 minutes, or until golden-brown and tender."

Add the strawberry puree, sugar and lemon juice to a medium size pot. Place on the stove and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch with the cold water and then add to the pot. Bring to a simmer and simmer 4-5 minutes until slightly thick, but still jelly like. Remove and set aside to cool and thicken more.",
        "2. While the filling cools make the dough. In a small bowl mix the whole wheat flour, oatmeal, baking soda, cornstarch, salt and cinnamon together. Set aside.",
        "3. Cream the coconut oil, greek yogurt and honey together in the bowl of a stand mixer or other large mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat until combined. Slowly add the dry ingredients and beat until combined. The dough should come together, but be wet.",
        "4. Line a work surface with wax paper and lightly flour the wax paper. Divide the dough in half, cover one ball and place the other on the wax paper.",
        "5. Lightly sprinkle the dough ball with flour and then place another sheet of wax paper on top. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle. Using a pizza wheel, pastry cutter or sharp knife cut out as many 4x4.5 inch squares as possible. I was able to get 2 squares and then re-roll the dough an get 2 more.",
        "6. Down the center of each square, spoon 1-2 tablespoons of the strawberry filling right down the center, but leaving about 1/4 inch on either end clean. Fold one side up and over the filling and then pinch the dough together at either end. Do the same for the other side. Carefully roll the bar over and place the seam side down on a baking sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Repeat with remaining dough and squares.",
        "7. Once all the dough has been used and you have 8 or so bars on the baking sheet, cover and place the baking sheet in the freezer for 15 minutes.",

Fill bottom of double boiler with water, making sure the water doesn’t make contact with the base of the top bowl of the double boiler.  Bring water to a gentle simmer (bring water to boil, then reduce to very low heat).  Place white chocolate in top bowl of double boiler.  Using rubber spatula, gently melt the chocolate.  In a small bowl, mix powdered freeze-dried strawberries with 2 Tbsp of the vegetable oil.  Add this strawberry paste to the melting white chocolate and mix in until you get a evenly pink colored dipping chocolate.  Mix in another 1 tsp of oil, then remove the bowl from heat, and wipe steam off the outside of the bowl with a tea towel.￼2. Carefully pour the melted chocolate into the drinking glass to a height of 4″.",
        "3. Dip the cut grissini into the melted chocolate leaving the top 1″ undipped.  As you get further along in dipping, you may need to tilt the glass to distribute the chocolate upwards so that you are able to cover all 4″ of each grissini with the chocolate.  Gently shake off any excess chocolate, then place the dipped cookie on the small baking sheet or plate fitted with parchment.  Let the Pocky stick sit here for about a minute to allow any excess chocolate to pool onto the parchment/paper plate.",
        "4. Transfer the stick to the large parchment lined baking sheet to fully dry.  Repeat the dipping process with the remaining grissini.  The Pocky take about 1 hour to fully dry/harden.  In a pinch, you can place them in the fridge to speed up the drying process.  Homemade Pocky are best eaten within a day or two, as the bread sticks tend to soften with time.￼Variation: Generously or lightly scatter finely diced freeze-dried strawberries, chopped nuts, crushed flax seeds, or sprinkles on the dipped Pocky before transferring the cookie sticks to the large parchment lined baking sheet to dry."

Once hot, fry the sopapillas on both sides for one minute each.￼Remove the sopapillas to a plate lined with paper towels for draining.Once sopapillas have drained you can tear them open to reveal the inner “pocket” and stuff them with your desired filling.￼You can also drizzle honey on warm sopapillas for a dessert serving."

Try to purchase what you can at your local grocery store or gourmet food store, then order online whatever you cannot find.-Leave out the popcorn seasoning. Although it helps make the seasoning, it isn’t necessary so long as you don’t mind it not tasting as much like Doritos.-Split the Dorito powder measurements in half. I made mine so that I could use the Dorito  flavoring again in the future, therefore resulting in a lot of leftover powder. You do not need to do this if you want to minimize the amount of spices your use.",

IMMEDIATELY use a fork and spatula to fold one side over before it hardens to shape the taco. I use the spatula to hold up one side, then the fork to separate the other.Once the shell is hardened in shape, turn over to cook other side well.

        "Quicky or Healthy Options:-If you don’t want to fry, try to spray with a little oil and bake in oven. You will want to use something to keep the sides folded but separated. Try rolling up some wax paper or aluminum foil into a tube, spraying with oil and place in between the taco sides.-Using a little Smartbalance on a skillet and frying the same as with the oil but directly onto the skillet.-A quicker option is to buy corn tortillas and fry or cook the same. You simply need to fry or bake for less time.*I cannot say as to whether any of these other techniques will make the taco taste as good.

        "1. Preheat the oven at 400 degrees. ￼2. Line a tray with foil.￼3. Place 2 tortillas on a flat surface and lightly glaze/brush both sides of the tortilla with Canola Oil.￼￼4. Place both tortillas on the foil tray.￼5. Once the oven preheats, place the tortillas in the oven for 10 minutes – 5 minutes on each side so they crisp up.  You can add multiple tortillas if you have room.￼6. In the meantime, make the beans.  Empty the contents of the refried beans into a small pot.￼7. Add a 1/4 cup of water.￼8. Place the pot over a stove on low-heat. ￼9. In the meantime, chop an onion.  Add the onion to the beans.￼￼10. Add the seasonings – paprika, black pepper, and taco seasoning.  I don’t think you will need salt.￼11. Mix.  Wait a couple minutes and once heated thru, turn off the stove.￼12. In the meantime, chop the veggies. ￼￼13. Check on the tortillas.  DON’T TURN OFF THE STOVE.  See how they are crispy once baked. ￼14. Spread a couple dollops of beans over the tortilla.￼15. Top off with very little salsa.￼16. Spread.￼17. Place the second piece of tortilla on top.  Now top with salsa.￼18. Spread salsa again – very little. ￼19. Top with scallions and tomatoes.￼20. Add just about 1/2 to 1 tsp of deseeded jalapeno – see how much you can handle.￼21. Top with cheese, make sure you get the sides. ￼22. Using a flat ladle place the Mexican Tortilla Pizza on the foiled tray. ￼23. See, I made 2.  Into the oven for 12 minutes – I like my cheese slightly browned. ￼￼24. Cut into 4 pieces and don’t share with anyone!￼￼24. YO QUIERO PIZZA MEXICANA!  MUY CALIENTE Y DELICIOSO! ￼￼25. Top off with a dollop of Sour Cream (reduced fat) and some Hot Sauce, just cause it's awesome!"

This will take about 2 to 3 minutes.  You definitely don't want to dry the shrimp by overcooking them. ￼In a wok heat  the oil and saute the garlic until fragrant. ￼Apart from the chicken stock and Shrimp add the rest of the the ingredients.￼When the oil separates add the chicken stock. Bring it to a boil and reduce the sauce to a slightly thick consistency.Note: You can even make this a gravy dish. Just double the amount of chicken stock and thicken the gravy with cornflour and serve with rice. ￼Add  the shrimps until they are well coated with the garlic saute mix.￼This spicy and garlicky dish is great for any occasion. It can be served with rice or noodles. It can also be served on its own as an appetizer. ￼Enjoy!"

      "notes": [
        "1. Sweet dark soy sauce is thicker and sweeter than normal soy sauce, and has a more complex flavour. It is available in Asian grocery stores and in the asian section of some large supermarkets. A great substitute is kecap manis which is an Indonesian sweet soy sauce. Hoisin sauce would also be an acceptable substitute. Otherwise, to make your own substitute, use 1½ tbsp soy sauce with 1 tbsp honey instead of 2 tbsp sweet soy sauce.2. If you can't find Chinese broccoli, you can substitute with other leafy Chinese vegetables such as pak choy or bok choy. You can also add other vegetables if you wish.3. You can substitute the chicken with other proteins suitable for stir frying, even tofu or prawns.4. You can use other noodles if you want, fresh or dried, rice or egg noodles. However, I do not recommend using vermicelli as it is too thin for the strong flavours of the sauce.5. If you accidentally add the noodles into the pan before checking they are properly rehydrated, simply add ½ cup of water to the pan and bring it boil, tossing the noodles to finish \"cooking\" them. It won't take long because rice noodles do not require much cooking - maybe 1 minute or so, and the dish will still come out fine (though if you already added the broccoli leaves then they will be very wilted rather than just slightly wilted)."

Leave remaining oil in the pan.Add red pepper flakes, fish sauce, sugar, lime, water and tamarind (if using) to the food processor and blend until a thick paste forms (if needed, add a couple more tablespoons of water to make the blending process easier.)Return the paste to the frying pan and stir it into the oil over low heat, gently simmering until you get a fairly even consistency, a couple of minutes should do.Adjust the consistency by adding a little more water if you find it too thick.In a shallow dish combine Thai sweet chili paste, soy sauce (or coconut aminos) and grated ginger and mix until well combined.Add the salmon fillets, skin side up and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) and place a rack in the middle.Line a baking sheet with aluminium foil and lightly grease it with olive oil (alternatively you can use a cast iron skillet).Place salmon fillets onto the prepared baking sheet, skin side down, and drizzle some of the marinade over them.Cover with aluminium foil and bake for 15 minutes, turn on the broiler, remove foil, and broil for further 3 minutes or until the top is golden brown.Transfer to a serving platter and serve!"

Add 2 tbs of oil, salt, ½ cup of warm water and use a knead­ing hook to mix until com­bined (it will be a bit dif­fi­cult at this point in a large food proces­sor because you’re not work­ing with much, you can use a wooden spoon). Now add 4½ more cups of flour and 1 cup of water, and mix. Hold back on both for the last bit – we need dough that is man­age­able and soft, but not sticky. Keep mix­ing until a nice elas­tic ball is formed, about 3 – 5 minutes.3.Remove from the bowl and knead a few times by hand to shape into a ball. Put in a greased bowl, loosely cover with plas­tic wrap and then a damp kitchen towel. Let rise until dou­bled in size, about 1 hour.4.Pre­heat the oven to 450F and place the pizza stone inside. Pre­heat the stone for 30 minutes.5.Remove the dough from the bowl, and flat­ten to release air bub­bles. Use a rolling pin to flat­ten into thin (1/ 4 inch) rounds. Gen­er­ously sprin­kle a baker‘s pad­dle with corn­meal and trans­fer the crust onto it. Put your top­pings on the crust.

That would make a nice post too :)",
        "Lazy Fresca Basics..",
        "Lazy Frescas. The trick to a lzy fresca is choosing fruit or veg that will easily dissolve into water when given a brisk stir and a gently mashing. It is almost like you will be making “fruit tea” Instead of a tea bag steeping in hot water, you are “steeping” some soft, ripe, fresh fruit.",

        "Strawberry Lemon MintPeach Berry GrapefruitCucumber lime mintRaspberry Mint LimePineapple Lime CilantroOrange KiwiLemon MelonWatermelon LimeCucumber Basil Lime",
        "..you get the idea.",
        "Step Two: Choose your liquid.I like to use sparkling mineral water because I like my frescos fizzy. But still water works too. Just make sure it is chilled. You can also add a splash of something sweet. I like to add a splash of fresh orange juice or something fizzy like sparkling lemon, peach, apple or orange soda.",
        "Step Three: Choose your sweetener.I like agave syrup because it easily dissolves into the water – and acts as a simple syrup.",
        "Step Four: Prep your fruit.You will need a good amount of fruit per glass since this will be what flavors your water. Adding frozen fruit can be very helpful because as the frozen fruit melts into the water it easily saturates the water with flavor. (For instance, drop a fresh blueberry into water and not much will happen. But drop a frozen blueberry into water and it will turn blue!) Frozen fruit also chills your beverage nicely. Another trick is to gently mash some of your fresh fruit to release the flavor.",
        "Step Five: Assembly.Add your fruit, sweetener, water to your serving glass. Stir/mash briskly and allow to chill in the fridge until ready to serve."

If your pie has risen in the center, it will deflate as it cools. Allow pie to cool in pan for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving; however, for optimal results, cool overnight because it gives the flavors a chance to marry and the pie to really set up fully. Pie will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months (color may leech from the M&Ms if you freeze it)."

        "Following the recipe, cook time was about 26 minutes – I cut back on the cook time from ten minutes to eight minutes for the final part.  It only took me 10 minutes of preparation time but I used pre minced garlic.  In the first part of the recipe where you brown the chicken I used 1 teaspoon of olive oil. I then add a teaspoon when I took the chicken out and added the mushrooms.  When I removed the mushrooms, there wasn’t much oil for sautéing the onions so I added a dash more."

      "notes": [
        "ChocolateThere are two types of chocolate, semisweet chocolate chips and unsweetened chocolate, that are melted with the butter to form the base of this recipe. This method comes from these Thick and Fudgy Toffee Brownies. I find it gives the perfect balance of chocolate flavor without tasting too bitter or intense. While I like big chocolate flavor in my brownies, I don’t want them to taste as rich as a truffle or flourless chocolate cake. I also experimented with adding cocoa powder to the batter because I love that distinct cocoa taste it imparts, and I especially love these cocoa brownies. However, each time I tried to add cocoa it took away from the fudgy moistness of the brownies and made them more dry and crumbly. This is because cocoa powder does not contain cocoa butter, so cocoa powder brownie recipes require more butter to add moistness and richness. The recipe already has a lot of butter, so I settled on using just melted chocolate. I think it imparts a perfect fudgy, chewy, moist texture without feeling like straight-up undercooked batter. These brownies aren’t remotely cakey but they have a nice soft chew. Be sure to let the melted chocolate cool slightly before adding it to the batter, you don’t want to scramble your eggs with molten hot chocolate.",
        "ButterThe recipe takes 1 1/2 sticks of unsalted butter (6 ounces or 12 tablespoons) and melts it down with the chocolate. This helps prevent the chocolate from seizing if melted by itself, and allows the ingredients to become homogenized. To make these brownies ultra thick and tall, we’re basically baking a 9×13-inch pan worth of batter in an 8×8-inch pan. That’s why there seems to be so much butter. The reason we melt butter in brownie recipes instead of beating room temperature butter with sugar is because that helps give a rich, chewy, fudgy texture. Beating butter incorporates air and gives a more light, airy, cakey texture which we don’t want in a brownie. Well, you might want that but I don’t! Also, feel free to use salted butter, just omit the salt called for in the recipe.",
        "Sugar1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar is called for in this recipe. Again, if this seems like a lot that’s because these are very tall brownies so there is a lot of batter. Also, we’re using a large amount of unsweetened chocolate so we need to sweeten the brownies up a little. The sugar doesn’t just provide sweetness, it also affects the texture. Some brownie recipes call for a combination of granulated sugar and brown sugar. I love brown sugar, but find it imparts too much moisture into brownie recipes and prevents the crinkly crust on top from forming. Additionally, this brownie recipe is different than usual because instead of simply adding the sugar into the melted butter and chocolate mixture, we actually beat the sugar with the eggs. That’s right, we use an electric mixer to beat the sugar with the eggs for three whole minutes until the mixture is light and ribbon-thick. Why? This ensures the sugar is completely dissolved as it enters the oven, enabling a soft yet fudgy texture and crinkly crust. I learned this technique from this brownie recipe. It’s amazing and will change your brownie baking.",
        "EggsAs you may know, eggs not only act as a binding agent in baked goods but they also add structure, richness, and enhance texture. This recipe calls for three whole eggs plus one egg yolk. Why the yolk? The fat in the yolk creates a rich, moist, fudgy, chewy texture that just melts in your mouth. I love adding an egg yolk to my cookie recipes too to get them really chewy. Try it!! Also be sure to use large eggs. I was so pleased when I discovered I was able to add an egg yolk and STILL get that tissue-thin crust on top. Beating the eggs and sugar is pretty magical.",
        "FlourAll-purpose flour is the way to go here, cake flour makes these brownies way too tender and light. To make chewy fudgy brownies, we only need to use a little bit of flour. Any more flour will create tougher or cakier brownies. If you want to be super accurate and weigh your flour, 3/4 cup equals 94 grams or 3.3 ounces.",
        "Baking and StoringBake these brownies in a 350°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Do NOT overbake. Seriously. There will absolutely be moist crumbs attached to a tester by the end of the baking time. That’s what we want. Even after 40 minutes if the middle still seems too moist, just remove the brownies from the oven. You’ll thank me for it after they’ve cooled. The brownies definitely taste best the day they are baked, but can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature or up to 4 days in the fridge. They are even more fudgy when they’re chilled. You can microwave them for a bit to serve them warm too. It’s up to you!"

Depending on the kind of knife you use, most blades are shaped at an angle, so don’t bring the knife down in one push, the uneven pressure will crack the bark.

Fry wings for about 5 to 7 minutes, and then drain on a wire rack. Depending upon the side of your pot fry 5 or 6 wings at a time. Be sure to stir the wings once during cooking to make sure that the wings cook evening. Cook the wings until they just begin to brown. Bake wings for about 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.",
        "Prepare the sauce by melting the butter and the garlic powder in a small pan. When the wings have finished cooking in the oven place the wings into a large bowl. Stir in half of the Parmesan cheese into the melted butter. Pour the melted garlic butter over the wings and toss until the wings are well coated. Serve the wings by sprinkling the remaining Parmesan cheese top of the wings."

      "notes": [
        "For the alternative butter sauce, I want you to chop your garlic fairly fine, and simmer it butter for about 5 to 7 minutes. I want you to simmer the garlic until it becomes tender and begins to make your kitchen smell wonderfully fragrant. Then add in your Parmesan cheese. The fresh garlic adds a dimension to the sauce that everyone will love.",
        "One other cooking tip here, this is about the only time I will tell you it is ok, in fact, preferred that you use the Parmesan cheese that comes in a can. I know, I feel a lot of shame saying that right now. I like that in this form it won’t melt rapidly and that it represents more of what the restaurant does. Actually it just works better in this case. It retains its shape and makes more of a flaky coating than it does when it is all melted.",
        "I promise when you finish making these wings, you will be proud that you can make the best garlic Parmesan wings. I have to add one more thing, they don’t reheat well. Reheating wings means you get a soft almost soggy outside. While they don’t taste bad, they just aren’t quite as exciting as they are when you first serve them, but who is going to have leftovers anyway?"
